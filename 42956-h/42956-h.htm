<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Some</span> apology or explanation may be deemed requisite,
for delaying the publication of this "Story of
the Zulu War" for more than a year after its
conclusion. The little book itself was written very
shortly after the capture of the king, Cetywayo, and
the tardiness of its appearance has been, to a certain
extent, intentional on my part.</p>

<p>Although it may seem ungracious and, perhaps,
ungrateful to cavil at the war criticisms and descriptions
which, by every post and telegram, adorn
the pages of contemporaneous journalism, I would
submit that the practice of writing <i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i> on
war topics the day after an engagement, is too
early to allow us to examine motives as well as
facts, so that we may form conclusions to which we
can only justly arrive, when "Time, the corrector,
where our judgments err," has softened prejudice
and exposed partisan feeling. The worst and most
valueless criticisms on Waterloo were given to the
world immediately after the fight of Mont St. Jean.
The most unreliable, and indeed erroneous, opinions
in regard to the splendid errors of Inkerman and
Balaklava, appeared before the Crimean war was
ended, and many a hero, elevated by the verdict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
contemporaneous eulogy to a temporary pedestal in
the Temple of Fame, has since been dethroned by
the calmer and more honest judgment of a later
generation. When the Emperor Napoleon called us
a "nation of shopkeepers," he, perhaps, intentionally,
paid us a compliment; for peace, commerce, and prosperity,
have, as a rule, I venture to hold, been more
regarded in our islands than projects of violence,
warfare, or conquest; and this with us has ever
been an honourable characteristic of the Spirit of
our present Age.</p>

<p>But as Sir Bartle Frere, one of England's greatest,
wisest, and most humane administrators, was well
aware, the great and time-honoured law of self-defence
sometimes compels a State, like an individual,
to resort to arms, and the Appeal of Battle,
when all peaceful modes of arrangement have been
vainly tried, becomes occasionally unavoidable.
Then, and perhaps only then, we may be allowed,
even by the Peace Society and the Acolytes who
trim the lamps for Mr. John Bright, to take an
interest in and feel proud of the disciplined courage,
the love of honour, and the sense of duty of which
we read in the campaigns, where those who are near
and dear to us have fought and fallen under the
British flag. Then the commanders we may have
known as subalterns, but whose names are now
in all circles as veritable "Household Words;"
whose careers we have watched with proud, yet
kindly sympathy, and whose triumphs we have seemed
as countrymen to share; whose powers of intellect
and prescience array, regulate, and wield at will
the grim and stern materials at command; whose
daring, and yet coolness in the midst of death, acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
like a talisman upon the rank and file&mdash;whose providence,
when one path fails, is ever ready for fresh
resources and designs&mdash;are not these the men of
whom we may say with Tacitus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center noin"><i>"Ratio et consilium propri&aelig; Ducis artes"?</i></p>

<p class="noin">and of this class, I venture to think, were Lord
Chelmsford and his lieutenants. And when we
are ourselves in the "sere and yellow leaf," or
have joined, mayhap, that "larger majority" which
Gladstonian tactics and energy cannot hope to rival,
our children and children's children, when they
read of such names as Bartle Frere, Chelmsford,
Wood, Pearson, Buller, and Piet Uys, may look
back to English History and see that our "island
mastiffs" have not become degenerate, either in
courage or generosity, since the days of Harold, the
Black Prince, or that knightly Sydney who fell at
Zutphen!</p>

<p>Some experience of the Kaffir tribes and their
characteristics, of the physical and geographical
difficulties which attend upon a campaign in South
Africa,&mdash;dating, indeed, as far back as a score of
years ago, and the interest which I have since taken
in colonies where, as an Adjutant, I passed some
very happy years among Boers, B&ocirc;k, and Kaffirs, had
at the commencement of the late war prompted me
to follow its various phases, with a view to write the
story of the campaign. In this purpose I was encouraged
by the offers of many old comrades who
were about to start with their regiments for the seat
of war, and who promised me by each available opportunity
the assistances of their several journals, notes,
and sketches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But one I would select from that proud throng,<br /></span>
<div class="ml4">&middot;<span class="ml4">&middot;</span><span class="ml4">&middot;</span></div>
<span class="i0">And partly that bright names will hallow song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his was of the bravest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And to those who have known that most accomplished
gentleman and gallant soldier, young, brave,
cheery, and <i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i>, Edmund Wyatt-Edgell, I
need not say how delighted I was at his undertaking
to correspond with me, and, as far as time and
opportunity permitted, to keep me <i>au courant</i> with
the march of events. From the time of his arrival
at Natal to the fatal day on which he fell, he
fulfilled that promise, and if any merit be due to
the narrative I now present to public notice, it will,
I believe, come through those descriptions which I
received from my dead comrade and friend&mdash;<i>Sit tibi
terra levis!</i></p>

<p>Another motive, or perhaps more than one,
"pricked the sides of my intent," and invited me
to wield the pen upon a soil where erst I had
drawn a "regulation" sword. In the "unvexed
silence of a student's cell," i.e., London chambers,
I could only watch the progress of the campaign,
without hoping to share in its toils or its dangers.
I might envy, but I could not participate&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For who can view the ripen'd rose, nor seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear it?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In default of this, I could, however, follow in spirit
the adventures, by flood and field, of more than a
score of old comrades and companions in arms, who
were winning honour and renown in a land not
unfamiliar to me. In the hasty and, with all
deference I say it, somewhat ignorant criticism of
those amateur mentors who tell us how battles ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
or ought not to be won, and who, from the calm
solitudes of Fleet Street, would make or mar a
military reputation, I venture to believe, was much
injustice done to the Commander-in-chief of our
forces in South Africa.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A man must serve his time to every trade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save censure. Critics all are ready made."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And I was the more convinced of this partisan and
hostile feeling from the knowledge that, west of
Temple Bar, and especially in the regions where
veterans do most congregate, in the clubs and haunts
alike of <i>vieilles moustaches</i> and military neophytes,
from the "Senior" to the "Naval and Military,"
criticism was far less pronounced, and experience, as
it invariably is, was more moderate in stricture and
charitable in argument than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Lastly, the tragic fate of England's young chivalrous
and knightly guest, which formed such a
terrible episode of the war and draped our colours
with mourning, even in the hour of victory, made a
deep impression upon my mind, and caused me
insensibly to marvel at the unworthy sentiments to
which a large portion of the English public and the
English press at that time gave utterance. Political
feeling seemed then, as it now seems in poor Ireland,
to override all sense of manly honour, generosity,
hospitality, or common decency. The slaughter, for
it was nothing less, of the princely and noble lad, who
came to the shores of his country's hereditary foe,
as a messenger of hope, alliance and future friendship,
who had been taught by his father to love and
study our English laws and customs, and who, in
his abandonment in that fatal donga, must have
felt shame for the comrades to whom his safety was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
entrusted; the sacrifice, I say, of this pure and
devoted spirit, seemed to me to call for some record,
less evanescent than a passing note or a newspaper
article. If I have spoken strongly of the living in
my sorrow for the dead, as a soldier I can but plead
in vindication, that, in all my remembrance of the
records of our English army I can recall no instance,
save the one I have quoted, where an officer wearing
our royal uniform and holding a royal commission,
galloped away in front of his escort, and allowed a
comrade to be done to death in unknightly fashion!</p>

<p>In conclusion I may say that this little work,
although written <i>con amore</i> and from details
furnished to me by my friend, Captain the Hon.
E. V. Wyatt-Edgell, and others, lays no claim to
historical value, but assumes to be merely the
<i>impressions de voyage</i> of those who were actors in
the scenes described.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> Emashlabatini country was originally occupied
by a small tribe called the Abanguni; of its more
ancient kings little is known beyond that they seem
to have been of peaceful habits, making no wars,
but breeding cattle; also that the name of one was
Zulu. In their own country the appellation of
Abanguni in course of time died out, though still
used by their neighbours, and for it was substituted
Abakwa-Zulu (sons of Zulu), Zulu and Undabezita.
The tribe was composed of several families or clans,
each having its own chieftain. In the time of
Cetywayo's reign the names of these clans and
their respective chiefs were as follows:&mdash;The
Uhutilezi, a family having two branches; Umnyama,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Cetywayo's prime minister, was chief of
one, and Umtyubane of the other; the Ubixela
and Umgazi, who were divisions of one family, the
former owning Umvumhlana as chief, the latter
Sigodi&mdash;subsequently slain at Isandhlwana&mdash;whose
predecessor was Panda's prime minister Masipula,
and his successor Mapoko; the Umtombelo and
Umblalosi, also two branches of one family, whose
respective chiefs were Mabanda and Segetwayo;
the Uquabe, whose chief was named Rouhlo; the
Uzimgu, whose chieftain rejoiced in the appellation
of Unfanawenklela; the Fakazi, whose chief was
Umkasana; the Umtanzi, with a chieftain Umbono
by name; and the Igazi, whose head was Umkanyile;
the Amagungebe, their chief was the notorious
Sirayo; the Ukanyile, whose chief was Upagatwayo;
the Ulanga, their chief Umhlaka; the Umpingose,
whose chief was Ganse; and the Umhloben, a
scattered family having no head.</p>

<p>The word Zulu, or Undabezita, was invariably
employed in addressing any member of these
families, whatever his rank or station might happen
to be.</p>

<p>The first king of whom any particulars are known
was Senzagacone, son of Ufaina. When this king
began to reign he had no legitimate offspring: he
had, however, a natural son by Unamdi, daughter of
Umkeki, chief of the Langmene tribe, named Chaka
(the bastard). He afterwards married this Unamdi,
by whom he had a daughter Nuncoba, but no sons.
She being his favourite wife, the king, according
to the custom of the country, "gave her for a son,"
his natural son Chaka, thus legitimating him.
When Chaka was fifteen, his father, thinking he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
might become troublesome, sent to kill him; but
Chaka, being warned, fled to Dingiswayo, chief of
the Umtwetwa, where he remained until the king's
death, though on the occasion of his legitimation
an invitation was given him to return to the
paternal kraal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Chaka had become an Induna of great
influence and popularity in the land of his refuge;
so when on the death of Senzagacone the Zulu
tribe sent to him requesting him to be their king,
and he consented, all the tribes through which he
passed on his way to the Zulus accompanied him;
and the whole of the Zulu clans assembled to meet
him, and he was made king with great rejoicings.
In the interim between Senzagacone's death and
Chaka's accession, Umkaibye (paternal aunt of
Chaka) ruled the Zulus and arranged for Chaka's
return. It was now that the jealousy long
smouldering between the Umdwandwe and the
Umtwetwa, the two most powerful tribes in that
part of Africa, broke into an open quarrel. Uzwidi,
chief of the former, attacked and utterly routed
the latter, killing their chief, Dingiswayo, Chaka's
friend and protector. The worsted tribe naturally
applied to Chaka for help. Thereupon Uzwidi
immediately marched to attack the Zulus, and a
great battle ensued on the south of the White
Umvolosi. The result was that the left wing of
either army was victorious; but both lost so
heavily that they retired to their respective
countries.</p>

<p>On his retreat, Chaka was attacked by the
Langmeni, but failing in their assault, this tribe
then deserted their own country and joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Umdwandwe. Having defeated another coast
tribe which assailed him, Chaka occupied both
these countries, leaving the Emashlabatini district
waste and uninhabited.</p>

<p>Uzwidi had now gathered a fresh army, which
Chaka, by a night march, surprised and defeated
between Kwagmagwasa and the Umhlatuzi river.
He then retreated, but was rapidly followed up by
Uzwidi, who had soon regathered his forces, and
who succeeded in capturing much Zulu cattle and
slaying a number of men, women, and children,
surprised in their kraals by the swiftness of his
advance. He then again retreated. Uzwidi now
made a great and final effort to crush his adversary.
All the tribes around were pressed into his service,
and the result was that he soon had an army&mdash;collected
from ten tribes&mdash;far superior in point of
numbers to the Zulu force, which represented only
two tribes. Chaka therefore retreated before
Uzwidi's advance, and eventually occupied a strong
position on the Inkankla range. Here he awaited
his opponent's onset. In place of the old missile
weapon, Chaka had armed his men with a shorter
and stronger assegai, intended for use at close
quarters; he therefore gave them strict orders not
to throw their assegais but to charge the foe and
fight them hand to hand. He also skilfully placed
his force amidst broken ground, so that it was
impossible for the enemy to attack in a compact
and organized body. The battle, as usual, began
in the early morn and continued till after midday.
The Zulus, carrying out their leader's instructions,
waited till the assault was delivered, and then
charged so vigorously on the foe that they swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
everything before them. Chaka following up this
defeat utterly dissipated the Umdwandwe army.
Uzwidi fled beyond his own country, which Chaka
annexed, and thus became the chief potentate in
that part of Africa, levying tribute from all the
tribes around him. Chaka now waged several wars.
First he attacked and despoiled the Mangwani, a
tribe on the Drakenberg; then he fell upon and
extirpated the clan of Zulukanafu, a chief residing
to the north of that range. Soon after he sent an
army against the Pondos, which captured a considerable
amount of cattle and then retreated.
Again, in the following year, there was a similar
expedition, and the Pondos sued for peace, which
was granted. By this time Chaka claimed to rule
over the entire country, from the sea to the Pondola,
to the Drakenberg, and to the land of the Pondos.
His next object was to consolidate his power.
Accordingly, the petty kings under his rule were
no longer recognized as such, but became tributary
chieftains; if any one of these was remiss in payment
of his tribute, an "impi" was sent "to eat
him" up. From time to time Chaka would also call
up these chiefs to his royal kraal, where he would
receive them with marks of distinction, and ask
their advice on state matters. Another important
step to weaken the power of the chiefs, and at the
same time to augment his own, was the establishment
of a standing army. Military service was
made compulsory on all males, each being told off
to a certain regiment according to his age. Thus
a man ceased to serve under the chief of his own
clan, but belonged to a king's regiment, which was
composed of men of all tribes. Similar divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were also made amongst the females, who had to
marry into regiments at the king's commands,
though on a marriage cattle was still handed over
to the bride's father or brother. Furthermore,
regiments were not allowed wives till they were
entitled to wear "head-rings," and this did not
occur till men had reached forty years of age.
Chaka's next war was against the Swazis, whom
he defeated and made to pay tribute.</p>

<p>In the following year an immense expedition was
despatched against the Sotshangana, a people dwelling
across the Somba Mountains, beyond Delagoa
Bay.</p>

<p>So large was this army that Zululand was almost
denuded of warriors, an event which was taken
advantage of by Dingaan and five more of the king's
brothers, to treacherously fall upon Chaka, whom
they slew, together with his chief councillor, Umxamana.</p>

<p>The benefits conferred on his people by Chaka
can hardly be over-estimated; he had raised them
from a small tribe to a nation, and that nation a
dominant one. As the Quirites were amongst the
component tribes of the earlier Roman kingdom, so
were the Zulus or Undabezita amongst the various
tribes subject to the central Zulu authority, and
curiously enough this resemblance extends still
further; the Quirites were subdivided into gentes,
or families, each with a distinctive name, and in a
precisely similar manner, as has been before stated,
the Undabezita were divided into sub-tribes or clans,
each with its own gentile or family name. Nor were
his people ungrateful to the memory of their first
great king, for after the time of Chaka, the bastard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that name was never employed in its original signification,
but to the present day a substitute, "Umlandhwana,"
is always used by a Zulu to express
that idea.</p>

<p>That Chaka was not averse to civilization and
white men was evinced by his treatment of Fynn
and five others who were rescued from a shipwreck
in St. Lucia Bay. He even went so far as to accompany
Fynn the whole way to Durban, to see him
embark on a ship sent round from Cape Town for
him, and to send at considerable expenditure in the
shape of cattle two envoys to England, which he
contemplated visiting himself, if their report should
prove favourable. But this latter project failed in
consequence of the king's murder, and the messengers
got no further than Cape Town.</p>

<p>A year or two after his departure Fynn returned,
and with Chaka's sanction established a trading-station
at Durban (1824). Once Fynn and some
white men, being called upon for aid, assisted Chaka
to punish a refractory tribe. When Chaka's army
for the second time invaded the Pondos, it was
through Fynn's representations that they would
come into collision with the white men that the army
proceeded no further.</p>

<p>On the army returning from the Sotshangana
expedition, Panda, a brother of Chaka, was requested
to assume the chief authority, but he declined, so
Dingaan became king. Dingaan commenced his
reign by killing all his brothers, except Panda, and
all the late king's most trusted ministers. This
caused great uneasiness amongst the chiefs, one of
whom named Umquetu wishing therefore to withdraw
from Dingaan's rule, departed with all his clan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and cattle to the south. Coming into collision with
the Pondos they were extirpated; hereupon Dingaan
despatched an army to recover the cattle, which he
regarded as his, from the Pondos. About the same
time another chief, Umzilikazi, also revolted, and
withdrew himself to the spot where Pretoria now
stands. An expedition was in a similar manner
despatched against him, and after capturing nearly
all his cattle, returned therewith to the king.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Boers had appeared on the scene
at Natal, and they now claimed from Dingaan a considerable
quantity of the cattle captured from
Umzilikazi, alleging it had been originally stolen
from them. To this Dingaan replied by bidding
them recover some cattle that a petty chief had taken
from him. Having done this and imprisoned the
captured chief at Maritzburg, the Boers again
applied for their own cattle, and a party under the
command of one Peter Retief was sent to Dingaan.
There now ensued a game of "diamond cut diamond,"
the Boers trying to outwit the king and capture him
in his kraal, and Dingaan acting in much the same
way to the Boers. The exact course of events is
unknown, but for certain in the result Retief and his
party were surprised and slain (Feb. 5th, 1838).
Dingaan then invaded Natal, slaughtered many of
the Boers, and captured much cattle. His forces
penetrated as far as Ladismith, whence, after a
heavy repulse in an attack on the Dutch laager, they
retired home. Encounters from time to time continued
to occur between the Zulus and the Boers
with varying success to either side, till at length a
peace was patched up. Panda showed himself so
active in this war as to excite Dingaan's jealousy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
consequence of which he, with all his people went
over and joined the Boers. Soon after this (Jan.
1840) the Boers, in conjunction with Panda, invaded
Zululand. The great fight occurred at Magongo, on
the Umkusi river. Dingaan was utterly defeated,
and retiring with a few attendants beyond the
Bomba range, was killed by the Swazis. Panda
now became king, and peace was made between the
Zulus and Boers, the former ceding to the latter the
Natal territory as far as the Tugela.</p>

<p>It was about this time that there occurred a
struggle at Natal between the English and Dutch,
in which the latter, being worsted, retired to the
Utrecht district, where they received permission
from Panda to dwell; Utrecht, it is said, being
assigned as their outside limit.</p>

<p>Panda waged no more external wars, but lived
peaceably in his kraal, breeding cattle. Most conspicuous
amongst the sons of Panda were Cetywayo
and Umbulazi; these two, having quarrelled, waged
a sort of civil war one against the other, and in the
result Umbulazi was defeated and killed. Amongst
the army of Umbulazi were John Dunn and about
thirty other white men armed with rifles. Cetywayo
then quarrelled with another brother, and the same
state of disorder continued till Panda's death, which
occurred in October, 1872.</p>

<p>Cetywayo being thereupon accepted as king by
the Zulu nation, applied to the English Government
to recognize him. Accordingly, Sir Theophilus&mdash;then
Mr.&mdash;Shepstone was sent as envoy, and publicly
crowned Cetywayo at the Umlambongmenya kraal,
on which occasion he spoke thus to the assembled
Zulus: "Here is your king. You have recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
him as such, and I now do also, in the name of the
Queen of England. Your kings have often met
violent deaths at the hands of their people, but if
you kill this one, we shall surely require his blood of
you." He then went on to say, "that as the
English had recognized him as king, they would
expect him to give all men a fair trial before condemnation.
Even a witch should be let off, and
merely sent away to another district." To this the
Zulus returned that they would kill any man who
went with the king's women, any man who ran
away with another's wife, any thief of cattle, royal
or otherwise; that a witch should not be put to
death on a first accusation, but should any persist in
witchcraft, he should be killed. And to this Shepstone
signified his assent. The chiefs then rose in
a body and said, "We will so govern the country
under our King Cetywayo, and we look to England
to support him as the king of the Zulu nation."
Shepstone replied that he hoped the Zulus would
live peaceably under the new king, whom England
would expect to adhere to the terms to which he had
just assented.</p>

<p>But these promises were broken on more than
one occasion. Cetywayo having called up his army,
and finding them tardy in response, and many
absentees on the plea of illness, forthwith sent a
regiment to slay all those thus absent, saying, "Sick
men are no good; I will save the doctors the
trouble of attending them." Again, one of the
divisions of females being ordered to marry a certain
regiment, objected that they were too few. Another
regiment was named, and further objections raised.
Then an impi was sent to punish these women, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a great number were killed. Great abuses in the
practice of "smelling out" by witch-doctors also
prevailed, though in this respect Cetywayo appears
slightly better than his predecessors.</p>

<p>It is now time to turn attention to what is called
the Boundary Question.</p>

<p>It has been previously stated that in Panda's time
the Boers had settled in the Utrecht district. From
time to time cattle undoubtedly was passed between
the Boers and the Zulu king. The former assert
that it was the price for the absolute ownership of
the land they occupied, whilst on behalf of Cetywayo
it is urged that it was merely a tribute from the
Boers, whose outside limit had been fixed at Utrecht.
Be this as it may, there kept occurring at frequent
intervals outrages, robberies, and reprisals on either
side, Sirayo, whose kraal was nearest the border,
being the most prominent actor in these scenes.</p>

<p>Umbelini also now appeared, to further complicate
matters. Originally a Swazi, he had fled from his
native land, and settled in Zululand, together with
his uncle Umbeliani and his people. This uncle
joined the Boers, taking his cattle with him. Land
was assigned to Umbeliani by the Boers close to
where Umbelini was dwelling. No sooner, therefore,
had the former built himself a kraal than the
latter attacked and destroyed it. Thus ensued a
contest between the Boers and Umbelini. The
Boers drove Umbelini from his stronghold, but
failed to capture him. He, retreating, erected a
new kraal on the Dumbe range, north of the Zlobani,
whence he continued to make raids into Swaziland
and the Transvaal, which had now become British
soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>At Cetywayo's coronation this vexed question of
the boundary had been referred to Mr. Shepstone,
and he, in accordance with a promise then given,
subsequently met the Zulu envoys at Conference Hill
to hear their claims in this matter. They then
claimed the Buffalo river as their original and
proper boundary. In reply, Mr. Shepstone said
that he considered this was asking too much; but
that a fair line would be the Blood river and the old
hunting road running close by the Kambula Kop to
the Pongola or Zulu side of Luneberg. He would,
however, examine the question more closely before
coming to a final decision, which, when arrived at,
would be communicated to them.</p>

<p>During all this time the Zulu army had been growing
more and more restless, and the younger men
especially were clamorous for an opportunity of
"washing" their spears. For this sole purpose they
contemplated a raid on the Swazis, then in alliance
with England. But on Cetywayo's applying to
the British Government for its sanction to this project,
it naturally declined to allow its allies to be thus
wantonly attacked.</p>

<p>There also existed amongst the Zulu an intense
antipathy to the Boers; and Cetywayo, after his
capture, himself admitted that had the Transvaal
not been annexed, it was a mere question of time how
soon a war broke out between his people and the
Dutch settlers; nor can this afford much ground
for wonder, when the characteristics of a Boer are
had well in mind. The typical Boer is doubtless a
pattern of hospitality, simplicity of heart, fondness
for his home and family, and of those general
domestic attributes which are so dear to an Englishman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
But in his relations and contact with the
native races and real owners of the soil, the Dutch
Boer seems to lose all sense of reason and justice,
and to remember only those early and blood-stained
annals of pioneering, when the white man and the
black neither gave nor asked for quarter in their
struggle for supremacy in the land. Indeed his intolerance
of a native is so intense that he cannot
be induced to look upon him as a human being, but
he regards the unfortunate aboriginal as a wild beast
to be hunted and shot down. But the Boer has his
fairer side, although his type has as yet been unchangeable.
As he existed when he ruled in Cape
Colony in 1808, so he now exists in the present day
in his settlements in the interior. He is uneducated,
uncultivated, unprogressive, and obstinate; but he
developes qualities under adverse circumstances
which must command English respect. He is
certainly domestic as far as his own family circle
is concerned, but, at the same time, the reverse
of gregarious in regard to the world in general.
When he first commences to farm and settle he
likes to possess not less than 6000 and not more
than 20,000 acres of good undulating "veldt."
When he has obtained this, he starts in his waggon
with his wife, his children, his scanty supply of
goods and chattels, his cattle and sheep, and his
only literature, the family Bible. He selects a good
spring of water, being careful that no neighbour is
located within at least ten miles. He builds his
house with one large central hall, with the kitchen in
rear, and four or five bedrooms opening out of the
hall, all on the ground floor, and sometimes with a
wide verandah outside. Kraals for his cattle, fences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to his garden, and enclosures of 50 or 100 acres,
are quickly run up; and so fertile is the soil and so
favourable the climate, that in four or five years his
garden will be full of oranges, lemons, citrons,
peaches, apricots, figs, apples, pears, and vines.
His herds and flocks multiply, his wheat and Indian
corn thrive, and thus he lives in a rude but grateful
abundance. His sons arrive at manhood and marry;
his daughters are sought as wives, and if the land is
good and plenty they remain and farm near, and for
each generation and new family a new house is built
a few hundred yards from the original. More acres
with each generation are brought under the plough,
and the man who is a good farmer, good father, and
good husband cannot be brought to see that he must
not covet his neighbour's land when that neighbour
happens to be a black man! Without sentiment,
without tenderness, and without a particle of enthusiasm,
and with the most circumscribed intellectual
horizon, he has a stubborn practicability which is
admirably suited for the work of a pioneer, but
which never developes into a power of civilization
amongst savage tribes.</p>

<p>As has been shown in the preceding narrative the
relations between the Zulu king and the English
Government had been growing more and more tense.
Two conspicuous outrages in the early part of 1878
at length brought matters to a climax. These two
events were the Sirayo affair, and the Middle Drift
difficulty. To understand the Sirayo business it is
necessary to enter somewhat into detail. Sirayo and
his tribe had a quarrel with one of the royal tribes&mdash;the
Ischeni. This, like many another tribal dispute
common enough in Zululand, never grew to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"assegai" matter, but encounters frequently
occurred, in which sticks only were used, and
the object of the rival factions was to drive off
the opponent's cattle. The result of this, and a
"law-suit" between the parties, settled by the king,
was that Sirayo lost all his cattle. Shortly after
this, one of Sirayo's wives, who had already been
put aside on account of having a son whose legitimacy
was suspected, being again in the family-way,
fled with her paramour into Natal. Another wife, in
a similar condition, also accompanied her. Nothing
was done at the time, but Sirayo's sons subsequently
learning that these women were in kraals close to
the border, having collected an armed band, crossed
the river Buffalo in broad daylight, seized one of the
women, recrossed the stream, and then killed her.
The Natal Kaffirs armed and threatened a rescue,
but made no attack on Sirayo's party, who, on the
same night, made another incursion, and the second
woman suffered the same fate as the first.</p>

<p>Thereupon the English demanded the surrender
of Sirayo's sons. Cetywayo sent to Sirayo advising
him to hand over cattle instead of his sons. Sirayo
replied that in consequence of the Ischeni dispute
he had no cattle; that he was aware that his sons
had transgressed; and that he was sorry. Again
the English insisted on the surrender of the two
young men. To this Cetywayo replied that they
were very young, and therefore their conduct should
be excused, and mercy shown to them. He added,
that beyond all doubt they had done wrong; that
the English had good cause for anger, and that he
himself was displeased with Sirayo for not sending
either his sons or cattle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The Middle Drift affair occurred thus:&mdash;At the
very beginning of 1878 the English were constructing
a road from Kranz Kop to the middle drift of
the Tugela. The men at work on this were interrupted,
and driven away from their task by the
Zulus living in the district, and Smith, the road
engineer, who had landed on the island at this drift,
was seized, stripped of all his clothing, and much
maltreated by the same people. Reparation was
demanded by the Government for this outrage.
Furthermore, from June, 1877, it was evident that
Cetywayo was instigating Secocoeni to hostilities;
and even allowing that part of this chief's claim for
compensation was just, it was necessary that the
former chief should be made to understand that
while arbitration was going on the law could not be
broken by either side. With great tact, Sir T.
Shepstone kept the peace until the Galeka and
Gaika war was over, when Lord Chelmsford and his
forces were freed, and it became possible to support
words by action. Such were the events which led
to the sending of an ultimatum by Sir Bartle
Frere.</p>

<p>In the beginning of December, 1878, therefore,
Messrs. John Shepstone, Brownlie, Walker, Fynn,
and Fyney were selected to be the messengers to
Cetywayo, to whom they were to communicate a
message, of which the following was the purport:&mdash;The
boundary-line was to be drawn from the junction
of the Buffalo and Blood rivers to the Magedala
Mountains, and thence on to the district of
Roundhill and the source of the Pongolo. All the
farmers on the frontier and disputed territory who
could produce any tangible evidence of damage or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
loss due to Zulu menace or warlike demonstration
were to receive a moderate but fixed compensation.
A fine of 500 head of cattle and the surrender of
the guilty members of the tribe was imposed upon
Usirayo's (Sirayo) people, and twenty days only
allowed for the payment of the penalty; 100 head
of cattle to be paid for the outrage upon Lieut.
Smith; Umbelini, who had given so much trouble,
to be handed over to and dealt with by the
Transvaal Government; the whole of King Cetywayo's
large army at once to be disbanded; freedom
of marriage to be allowed when the parties thereto
were of age; justice to be impartially administered;
missionaries to be allowed to return to the Zulu
country; British Residents to be appointed; all disputes
between Europeans to be referred to the king
and the resident; and, finally, no expulsion from
Zulu territory to be carried into effect without the
distinct approval of the resident.</p>

<p>It was further intimated to the king that unless
he showed his compliance with these terms, on or
before December 31st, then on January 1st, 1879,
the British army would commence the invasion of
his land, and would enforce them at the point of the
bayonet. The advance, it has been said, originally
was to have been made on the 1st; but his Excellency
the High Commissioner, allowing for the possibility
of letters being delayed by the swollen state of the
river, the Tugela being then in flood, extended his
term of grace to the 11th. A <i>Gazette</i> extraordinary
was published on January 6th, containing a declaration
from Sir Bartle Frere, demanding from
Cetywayo unqualified submission, stating that the
general would after the 11th instant demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
redress, and that the Zulu people were to be protected.
The following was its form:&mdash;</p>

<h3>"<span class="smcap">Notification by his Excellency the High Commissioner</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In July last two armed bodies of Zulus, retainers
of the Chief Usirago, led by his sons and brothers,
entered Natal and took away by force refugee
women, who were claiming protection from the
resident magistrate of Umsinga. These women
were dragged across the border, and, it is believed,
murdered. These acts of outrage were promptly
brought to Cetywayo's notice by his Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, but no explanation
or redress could be obtained from Cetywayo.
Twenty-one days were allowed to the Zulu king to
surrender the three sons and brother of the Chief
Usirago for trial, and as this term expired on 31st
December, 1878, the High Commissioner entertains
no hope that it is the intention of the Zulu king to
afford the redress which her Majesty's Government
has a right to demand.</p>

<p>"Therefore I hereby make known, for the information
of Cetywayo and all the Zulu people, that I
have placed the further prosecution of this and all
other demands for redress and reparation in the
hands of his Excellency the Lieutenant-General
Lord Chelmsford, commanding her Majesty's Forces
in South Africa, with the request that he will take
such steps as he may find necessary to protect the
British territory from further aggression, and to
compel the Zulu king to comply with all the
demands made on him for satisfaction due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
British Government, or for the greater security of
the British territory, or for the better and more peaceable
government of the Zulu people. Lieutenant-General
Lord Chelmsford will carefully notify to all
Zulu chiefs and people who may come within his
reach that the commands of the British Government
are made on Cetywayo, as much in the interests of
the Zulu people as of the English nation, and that
till the 11th January the Lieut.-General will be
willing to receive and to transmit to me any intimation
of the unqualified acceptance by Cetywayo of
all the terms offered to him. If such intimation of
unqualified and complete acceptance be received by
the Lieut.-General before the 11th January no
further hostile movement will be made, unless
rendered necessary by the action of the Zulu
forces, and up to the above date Lord Chelmsford
will be ready to consider any steps which the
Zulu king may propose for the purpose of giving
real and permanent effect to the demands of the
British Government. But unless all these terms be
fully complied with by the above date, the Lieut.-General
will no longer be bound by the terms of the
11th December, but will take such measures as the
forces under his command will permit for compelling
the submission of the Zulu king; always bearing in
mind that the British Government has no quarrel
with the Zulu nation, and that the future good
government and well-being of the Zulus is as much
an object of the steps now taken as the safety and
protection of the British territories of Natal and the
Transvaal. And I do hereby warn all residents and
inhabitants of her Majesty's possessions and colonies
in South Africa, of whatever race, to be guided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
this, my notification, and I do strongly charge and
command all her Majesty's officers, ministers, and
subjects, and all others whom it may concern, to
govern themselves and to act accordingly, and to
take due notice of and to pay due regard to the
tenor thereof.</p></div>

<p>During the whole of December Lord Chelmsford
had been indefatigable in collecting and organizing
the military forces at his command. The result
was that at this date (Jan. 11th) the return in the
order-book was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq2">Native Contingent&mdash;The Swazis, our native allies, some 5000

<p>An idea of the numbers and nature of Cetywayo's
force may be gathered from the report of the
Government Intelligence Department made at this
time.</p>

<p>"The Zulu army, as at present constituted, is
drawn from the entire male population, as every
male between the ages of fifteen and sixty-five is
called upon to serve, without any exemption. The
military force consists of fourteen corps or regiments,
divided into wings right and left, and the
latter into companies. The companies, however,
are not of equal strength, but vary immensely, even
from ten to 200, according to the numerical
strength of the corps to which they belong. In
fact, the companies and regiments would more
correctly be termed families or clans, and each
corps possesses its own military headquarters, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
kraal, with the following hierarchy, namely, one
commanding officer, chief, or Iduna-Yesibaya; one
second in command, major, or Iduna-Yohlangoti,
who has charge of the left wing; two wing officers,
and company officers according to the need of the
battalion. As a rule, all these officers are in command
of men of the same ages as themselves, and
the method of recruiting is as follows:&mdash;At stated
and periodical intervals, generally from two to five
years, a general levy takes place, when all the
youths who happen at that time to have attained
the age of fifteen are formed into a regiment and
undergo a year's probation, during which time they
are supposed to pass from boyhood to manhood.
As the regiment becomes disciplined and seasoned
it receives large drafts from other corps, so that as
the elders die out young men come in to fill up the
ranks. The entire Zulu army consists of thirty-three
regiments, married and unmarried. No one
in Zululand, male or female, is allowed to marry
without the king's permission, and this permission
is never granted until the men are about forty
years of age. They then have to shave the crown
of the head, and to put a ring round it, and carry a
white shield, in contradistinction to the unmarried
regiments, who do not shave their heads and carry
coloured shields. Many of these regiments are too
young for active service, others are too old, consequently
it is estimated that only about twenty-five
regiments would be able to take the field, and these
would muster perhaps 40,000. Of these 4500 are
between fifty and sixty years of age; 3400 are
between forty and fifty; 10,000 between thirty and
forty; and 22,000 between twenty and thirty. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
have heard a great deal about the drill of these,
but their movements, as far as we can learn, are
few and very simple, but very quickly performed in
their own way. They form circles of regiments in
order to outflank the enemy. From this formation
they break into columns of regiments or companies,
and from these into skirmishing order, with supports
and reserves. The sole commissariat of the Zulu
army consists of three or four days' grain, carried
by the lads who follow each corps, and, if necessary,
a herd of cattle driven with each column."</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> plan of the campaign now commenced was to
advance into Zululand in four columns, each column
complete in itself, having its own artillery, cavalry,
and independent leader. Each column was also to
keep up communications with the columns on flank,
thus creating, as it were, the effect of an advance
in one extended line.</p>

<p>By this means it was intended to thoroughly
sweep the entire Zulu territory, and at the same
time to prevent any large body of the enemy
from slipping between the columns, and so getting
to the rear and delivering a counter-attack on the
colonies.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular European forces, large
native levies had been raised, amounting in all to
7400. It is a great error to suppose that these
were without arms, dress, or discipline. On the
contrary, a great many of them came to us well
armed with serviceable-looking rifles, evidently of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Birmingham or Sheffield make, while some of the
older-fashioned fire-arms had the Tower mark.</p>

<p>Nor were they clothed only with the conventional
blanket. On the contrary, their uniform was neat,
and, at the same time, workmanlike, and consisted
of a corduroy tunic, or rather patrol jacket, and
breeches, with long boots of untanned leather, and
a broad-leafed <i>sombrero</i> as a head-dress.</p>

<p>Several native corps were rapidly formed, in the
following manner:&mdash;The commandant and his staff
officers were British officers, the captains mostly
retired British officers, colonists, or settlers; the
non-commissioned officers, white settlers of different
nationalities, and the privates usually Kaffirs.</p>

<p>Among the English officers who received commands
in this native contingent were Captain Nolan
(Pioneers), Major Bengough, Captain Russell (Rocket
Battery), Captain Ulich de Burgh (5th West York
Militia), Captain Cherry (32nd Foot), and Lieutenant
Hon. H. Gough. Colonel Durnford had command
of the whole column, which was to be entirely
native so far as the rank and file were concerned,
and to be composed of all the three arms&mdash;artillery,
cavalry, and infantry.</p>

<p>There was also a considerable contingent of
European Volunteers&mdash;more especially of mounted
men, whose total reached close on 1000. Conspicuous
amongst these were the Volunteer Hussars
and Alexandra Mounted Rifles, the Durban Mounted
Rifles, Captain Raaf's Diamond Field and Free State
Horse, and a contingent of mounted Boers under
Piet Uys, who gallantly responded to Colonel Wood's
spirited and soldierlike appeal. These Boers were
a splendid body of men, most of them crack shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with the rifle, and although somewhat fierce and
uncompromising towards their ancient enemies, the
Zulus, proved of invaluable service through their
knowledge of localities.</p>

<p>The following "special service" officers, sent out
from England, had also arrived and entered on their
respective duties:&mdash;Captain Cherry (32nd Light
Infantry), was placed in command of the 3rd battalion
Natal Contingent; Captain Gardner (14th
Hussars), was sub-director of transports at headquarters,
as well as Captain Huntley (10th Regiment),
who was posted to the River Mooi; Captains Essex
(76th), and Hon. H. Campbell (Coldstream Guards),
were also directors of transports. Major Hopton had
this duty at Pietermaritzburg. Captain Brunker,
of the Cameronians (26th), had the command of a
squadron of Light Horse. Captain Barton (7th
Regiment), was staff officer to Colonel Durnford;
Captains Pelly Clark (103rd Regiment), Spratt (29th),
and Lieutenant Lawrence (18th), were all employed
on transport duty at Durban, where, as most of the
ammunition and stores were landed, their office was
no sinecure. Captain Macgregor (29th Regiment),
was staff officer to Colonel Pearson, and Captain
Hart (31st Regiment) was on the staff of Lord
Chelmsford.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cetywayo's term of grace had expired;
the 11th of January had come and gone
without any sign from the Zulu monarch. On the
following day the war had begun, and the Tugela
was successfully crossed. By four o'clock on the
12th the Buffs, four companies of the 99th, the
Victoria Mounted Rifles, the native Sappers, the
1st Natal Native Contingent, and the Naval Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
were well over the Lower Tugela, near Fort Buckingham.
The pontoon worked remarkably well,
making three trips an hour. Four small boats were
also employed. A herd of cattle was brought into
the camp by the vedettes, who also reported that a
large Zulu force was in position about twenty miles
off, and also at Ondini. It has been mentioned that
four columns would be formed from out of the
three (whose details have been given above), and
these four were now advancing into Zululand in a
line which partly described a crescent, of which the
left extremity rested on Luneberg and the Pongolo,
the right upon the Lower Drift of the Tugela, close
to the sea, while the inner half of the circle was
represented by the boundaries of Natal and the
Transvaal.</p>

<p>The centre may be considered as being at Fort
Pearson, where there was a strongly entrenched
camp on the summit of a rising or bluff overlooking
the river Tugela. The column moving from Fort
Pearson consisted of 1500 regular infantry, that is
to say, eight companies of the Buffs, under Colonel
Parnell; six companies of the 99th, under Colonel
Welman; one company Royal Artillery and two
7-pounder guns, drawn by mules under Lieutenant
Lloyd; one Naval Brigade of 276 bluejackets and
Marines, under Captain Campbell, from her Majesty's
ships "Active" and "Tenedos," with three Gatlings;
200 Mounted Infantry, under Captain Barrow,
and 200 Mounted Volunteers (Durban Mounted
Rifles), under Captain W. Shepstone; the Alexandra
Mounted Rifles, Captain Arbuthnot; Victoria
Mounted Rifles, Captain Saner; Stanger Mounted
Rifles, Captain Addison; the Natal Hussars, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Norton. Colonel Pearson, of the Buffs, was
in command of the column, and had to co-operate
with him a native contingent of 2000 men, under
Major Graves, as well as two companies of the 99th
posted at Stanger and Durban. The total strength
of Colonel Pearson's column may, therefore, be set
down at 2200 Europeans and 2000 natives.</p>

<p>The second or right centre column moved from
Kranz Kop, a most formidable position, supported by
Fort Buckingham. This was the scene of operations
in 1861. The heights are commanding and look
over a wide field of country. The position is unassailable
except from the Natal side, and this was
strongly fortified. Colonel Durnford, R.E., commanded
this district and attack, and had with him
now the 1st Regiment Native Contingent, which
then consisted of three fine battalions, with three
rocket tubes, under Lieutenant Russell, and 250
mounted natives, making altogether 3300 natives,
officered by 200 European officers.</p>

<p>Following the line of advance to the left, and
occupying about fifty or sixty miles of frontier, we
come to column three, the left centre attack, commanded
by Colonel Glyn. Take any good map and
you will remark how the boundary winds serpentine
fashion in its length from Fort Buckingham to
Rorke's Drift and Helpmakaar. Helpmakaar made
an excellent base to Rorke's Drift. Being situated
on a lofty plateau, it formed an admirable place for
a permanent encampment. It also had dep&ocirc;ts at
Greytown on the one side and Ladismith on the
other. Colonel Glyn had with him seven companies
of the 1st battalion 24th and eight companies of the
2nd battalion 24th, six 7-pounder guns with Kaffrarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
carriages under Colonel Harness, a squadron
of mounted infantry under Captain Browne, the
Natal Mounted Police (150 men), the Natal Carabineers
under Captain Shepstone, the Buffalo Border
Guard (Captain Robson), the Newcastle Mounted
Rifles (Captain Bradstreet), also the native contingent
(2nd Regiment), 2000 strong, under Commandant
Lonsdale, officered by 200 whites. From
Rorke's Drift, about five miles over the river is
Ungusdana, and thence on the traveller comes to
the Intalalala river, which is about fifteen miles
inland. The country all about the district is rugged
and broken, and calculated to afford positions of
great defensive strength. Colonel Glyn was, if
possible, to bear a little to his left flank after
crossing the boundary with a view to communication
being opened with Wood's right flank. To
effect this connexion, however, there was a sad need
of cavalry.</p>

<p>We now come to the extreme left of the advance,
whose headquarters were Utrecht, and which was
thus composed:&mdash;Colonel Evelyn Wood, V.C., C.B.,
90th Light Infantry, commanding No. 4 Column;
Staff Orderly Officer, Lieutenant Lysons, 90th Infantry;
Principal Staff Officer, Captain Hon. R. G.
E. Campbell, Coldstream Guards; general Staff
duties, Captain Woodgate, 4th Regiment; transport
duties, Captain Vaughan, R.A.; senior commissary
officer, Commissary Hughes; commissary of ordnance,
Assistant Commissary Philimore; subdistrict
paymaster, Paymaster M'Donald; senior medical
officer, Surgeon-Major Cuffe. Corps&mdash;Royal Artillery,
six 7-pounders, Major Tremlett, R.A.; 1st-13th
Light Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Gilbert, 13th;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
90th Light Infantry, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel
Cherry, 90th; Frontier Light Horse, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Buller, C.B., 60th; Wood's Irregulars, 700
men, Commandant Henderson. In addition, a few
Boers were coming in, and more were expected.</p>

<p>Utrecht is the most southerly part of the Transvaal,
and lies upon the border of both Natal and
Zululand. It is separated from the former by the
Buffalo river, and, after crossing the Blood river,
a few marches bring one to the territories of King
Cetywayo. From the lowest, or most southerly
portions of Utrecht, just where the Buffalo and
Blood rivers form a junction, to the port of Durban,
on the coast of Natal, is but 100 miles, and the
capital city is about thirty miles from Newcastle,
the most northern of Natal towns. The two
districts are connected by a tolerably fair road and
a drift over the Buffalo river. Utrecht, in a
strategical point of view, wedged in as it were
between Natal and Zululand, cannot be equalled by
any position of a similar nature. The interior of
this district extends away to the summit of the
Drakenberg range, one of which reaches an altitude
of 4000 feet. Most of the Utrecht land lies in
what is called the "terrace country," and has the
advantage of the most splendid bracing air, added
to which are mountain ridge and peak, precipice,
wooded gorge, and grass-land, and scenery whose
characteristics are of a grander and nobler nature
than that of the Cape Colony. The portion of the
Drakenberg which runs through Utrecht has its
eastern front and glacis looking towards the sea,
which is about eighty miles distant, and as each
terrace or range slopes down the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
country changes, presenting many of the features
of the upper portions of the Cape Colony, that is
to say, broad undulating downs in one part and
immense flats covered with bush on the other.
All the principal rivers and streams of Utrecht and
their tributaries flow eastward to the Indian Ocean.
On one boundary there is the Pongola, and on the
other the Buffalo, while the Blood river passes
through it with a south-eastern flow, and the Pifan
does the same, but with an inclination to the north-east.
From the wild highlands between these two
streams issue the head waters of the Umoolosi,
which traverses Zululand and empties itself into
St. Lucia Bay.</p>

<p>Wood's column marched from Utrecht on the
7th, so as to be on the borderland in order to
operate with the right-hand column on the appointed
day. General Lord Chelmsford had given orders
that Colonel Wood was to be at a certain point on
the 10th, and consequently arrangements were
made to carry out these instructions. It was
known that Sirayo would probably oppose the
crossing of Colonel Glyn at Rorke's Drift, and
Colonel Wood had been told, if possible, to get
sufficiently near to operate on the enemy's right
and rear should such an attempt be made. Leaving
a small guard at his camps at Sandspruit, the rest
of Wood's force paraded in the lightest possible
order at 1.30 p.m. on the 10th, and marched from
two that afternoon until six p.m. A halt was then
made until 1.30 a.m., when by the light of a glorious
moon the advance was pursued. A mounted
advanced guard was thrown out, flanking patrols
were organized and told off, and the troops moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the greatest silence, not a word in the ranks
being allowed to be spoken. At 3 a.m., a short
halt took place, and the chief ordered forward a
reconnaissance, consisting of Buller's Light Horse,
two 7-pounder guns under Major Tremlett, and
twenty-four picked shots from the 13th and 90th
Regiments respectively. These men were to be
carried in some of the mule waggons, and were
accompanied by the 700 irregulars, horse and foot.
Colonel Wood accompanied this advanced force,
leaving the remaining (main) body in charge of
Colonel Gilbert, who was ordered to follow at a
fixed time. The advanced body arrived within ten
miles of Rorke's Drift at 7.30 a.m., and by eight
the camp fires were lit and the men comfortably
having their breakfasts on the banks of a small
stream; the mounted men having at once off-saddled,
the infantry piled arms, and the horses and mules
turned out to graze under a strong guard.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the general, Lord Chelmsford,
cantered up to the camp, accompanied by his staff
and an escort of 100 mounted infantry and some
Natal mounted police. The general seemed
delighted at the celerity with which his orders had
been carried out, as in eighteen hours Wood's party
had covered twenty-seven miles, and the men and
horses were as fresh as paint. A long consultation
took place with the general, and then the order was
issued for the return to the main body; but this
was not found necessary, as Colonel Gilbert met
them after about ten miles.</p>

<p>In this day, or rather twenty-four hours, the men
had marched thirty-one miles, and were not fated,
on camp being pitched, to enjoy the fruits of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
labour and toil, for soon after they were settled for
the evening a heavy thunderstorm came suddenly
over the tents, and in a quarter of an hour they
were up to their ankles in a perfect river of water.
The tents went down in all directions, and in many
cases poles were snapped. The next day, however,
a patrol of Buller's horse was paraded soon after daybreak,
as scouts had brought in information that a
large number of cattle were to be seen in the neighbouring
kloof. Soon after leaving camp Buller's men
were fired upon, but the Zulus did not stand their
ground, and by the afternoon they had brought in
nearly 1000 cattle. Captain Barton, who had gone
out later in the day with another party, marched
twenty miles in the direction of Umkanga's kraal,
where in the skirmish which resulted 550 cattle
were taken, and seven of the Zulus were killed and
wounded. On the following morning a strong
reconnaissance was made in the direction of the
Bushee Valley. The Zulus were in considerable
force, and their general tried to induce the English
skirmishers to follow him to ground of his own
choosing. Colonel Wood, however, kept his men
well in hand, and contented himself by sending forward
two companies of the 13th Light Infantry,
Colonel Gilbert's fine corps, and menacing the Zulu
flank with some score or more horsemen, who,
galloping to a favouring eminence, made capital
practice at the Zulu main body with their rifles at
700 and 800 yards. The Zulus still continued to
creep up in rear, getting what cover they could
from the bushes, and a sharp fire was kept up on
both sides. As the men in skirmishing order pushed
the enemy gradually before them, the mounted force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
harassed them on either flank, sometimes galloping
round to the right and left to obtain vantage-ground
and cover, and then dismounting in sections, and
acting as infantry, while the main body was kept
carefully out of sight in the dense mimosa which was
found in the rear. The bush, as they advanced,
gradually became more dense, and the path scarcely
allowed them to move in fours by a steep descent
into a wooded valley. Instinctively it was guessed
that here would be the main body of the foe, and
this turned out to be the case, for away to the left
front, on a tall "copjie" or circular hill, about
twenty mounted Zulus were to be seen, evidently
the commander and his staff giving orders and
directing the operations of the columns in the plain.
The firing had now become general, but the soldiers
were not allowed to waste their ammunition, and
nearly every shot told with fatal effect. Colonel
Wood had taken the precaution to strengthen his
flanks as he advanced, and as the enemy could not
tell how strong he was, the main body being still
invisible, they were completely puzzled by the
daring of the mounted men, who seemed ubiquitous.
The guns were found rather a nuisance; one of the
carriages broke down, and the limber had to be left
behind, while the gun itself was secured. The head
of the first line of skirmishers had now made good
their way through the kloof with slight loss, and
the Zulus attempted in vain to get round to its rear,
but found all hopes of such a man&#339;uvre utterly
futile&mdash;as the flanking parties were on the <i>qui-vive</i>.
It was now Wood's turn to push them, and he used
the opportunity. Two more companies were
advanced at the double to force the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Zulu line, and in a few moments we had cut it in
two. In the meanwhile one of the light field-pieces
had obtained a favourable position, and had got the
enemy's range exactly, but the execution done was
not what could have been obtained with a good
honest nine or twelve-pounder. The pursuit was
carried on for about a mile, and the Zulus were
scattered in all directions, but the commander was
too wary to allow his men to go too far, and the
recall was sounded, and in a short time brought
back the excited fellows, puffing and blowing, to
rejoin the main body.</p>

<p>For some days this column continued to advance
steadily without meeting any serious opposition.
Having moved on from the Blood River, Wood's
force encamped at Bemba's Kop till the 20th
January. The country over which they had passed
since they left Utrecht may be described as a succession
of large rolling plains, interspersed in all directions
by watercourses (<i>dongas</i>), which radiate from
the bases of the table-topped mountains rising at
intervals throughout this part of the country.
These watercourses are as a rule about twelve to
fourteen feet deep, and serve to irrigate the country,
which seems prosperous and well-populated. What
would be called a road in England does not exist in
Zululand. The tracks made by the traders with
their waggons answer the purpose. These tracks
are, however, tolerably good, and experience proved
that artillery could be moved almost anywhere,
except in wet weather. Waggons could pass each
other at almost any part of the main road from
Utrecht to Ulundi, except at that portion leading
across the Inhlazatye Mountain, which runs along a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
narrow ledge, and where it ascends the Intendeka
table-land. Wherever the troops moved they came
across numerous kraals, each kraal containing from
eight to fifteen huts, and each hut ten to fifteen
men. From Bemba's Kop they moved on the 20th
to Wolpoint, as nearly as possible seven miles west
of the White Umbolosi, and thence went on to
Tunguin's Neck, where a laager was planned and
completed. After a reconnaissance made by Colonel
Wood on the 22nd, in which his troops had a slight
skirmish with a small body of Zulus, suffering no
casualties, and inflicting a slight loss upon them, he
halted on the 23rd, and sent out strong patrols in
the direction of the Ingwazini River. These men
rode over an open plain admirably suited for cavalry
operations, but found nothing but some deserted
kraals and the dead bodies of some Zulus, who, it
was subsequently discovered, were wounded at
Isandula the previous day. On their return the
party were fortunate enough to discover the whereabouts
of a strong body, some 4000 to 5000 Zulu
warriors, who, it was imagined, were merely the
nucleus of a force intended to surprise Wood's
column. They were posted in a well-chosen position
at a place called Tintas Hill, and when they moved
down in his direction the following day, Wood had
concealed a portion of his force so well, that he got
them between two fires, and in about half an hour
had killed about sixty or seventy of them, his own
casualties being only two men wounded. It was
during this action that information was brought by
Captain Alan Gardner, who gallantly rode without
any escort from Helpmakaar to Utrecht, notifying
the terrible disaster of the 22nd, and the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of No. 3 Column. This news caused Colonel Wood
to change his plans, and after a halt of a couple of
hours, he turned back towards the Umbolosi, where
his little force arrived at seven a.m. on the 25th.
On Sunday (26th) he moved on to Ugaba Ka Hawana,
where good camping-ground and a defensive position
were chosen, and where the minor essentials
of wood and water were in plenty.</p>

<p>Colonel Pearson, who commanded No. 1 Column
on the extreme right, had also been prosecuting
his advance with the greatest vigour, and the results
were in every way satisfactory, though already the
tremendous difficulties of commissariat and transport
had made themselves unpleasantly evident.
This force assembled near Fort Stanger, and crossed
the Lower Tugela on the 12th, having as nearly as
possible 1500 regular troops, consisting of eight
companies of the old Buffs, under Colonel Parnell;
six companies of the 99th, under Colonel Welman;
one company Royal Engineers, and two 7-pounder
guns. A naval brigade, however, which might be
considered as a little army in itself, went with them,
and were under Colonel Pearson's command. This
force consisted of 270 bluejackets and marines,
under Captain Campbell, of her Majesty's ships
"Active" and "Tenedos," with three of the new-pattern
Gatling. Two hundred mounted infantry
and 200 colonial mounted riflemen also formed part
of the column, while the whole force was supplemented
by Major Griffiths and about 2000 men of
the Native Contingent. The crossing of the river
was at first impeded by the rains, and another delay
occurred at the lower drift, where the river was at
least 400 yards wide, but all these difficulties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
overcome, and after a week's delay a flying column
was sent forward on the 18th in the direction of
Ekowe, which is a mission-station not quite forty
miles inland, and distant nearly seventy from the
king's kraal at Ulundi. It was the intention of
Colonel Pearson to establish here an entrenched
post as a <i>point d'appui</i> to the invading army. On
the following day the colonel was followed by the
rear division, escorting the heavy baggage,
necessary though inconvenient <i>impedimenta</i>, as it
contained stores and ammunition. The column of
waggons extended for five miles, and it took the
officers in charge all their time and the services of
three horses each during the day to supervise its
progress from inspan till outspan. Again, two days
later, came the commissariat, and here imagination
fails to describe the difficulties encountered. The
subject of transport is one that must be considered
in any future operations in Africa. The waggons
must be stronger than those employed; the animals
should be proof against sickness caused by climate,
the tulip plant, and the tsetse fly, and this can be
avoided by choosing one's own season for marching.
The employment of mules would be much preferable
to that of oxen, although in many books the converse
is stated, the Dutch being infatuated in regard
to the superior qualities of the latter. Mules, for
instance, have this advantage over oxen. They can
travel twenty-five miles a day with ease, while
twelve or fifteen a day with oxen is considered
good work; but, on the other hand, it must be
remembered that a mule costs twice as much as an
ox, apart from the cost of feeding. The mule must,
of course, be fed on forage carried for him or bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on the road, while the ox will feed on the veldt,
except during the three winter months, when his
services are not often required. Two kinds of mules
can be procured about Pretoria&mdash;the Montevidean
and the home-bred animal. The latter is generally
preferred, although no doubt the former is most
tractable. There is an immense trouble in selecting
oxen for campaigning, as none but those bred in the
sour veldt of Natal or Zululand are of any use for
such rough food and hard work; and, as a rule,
these will live where others would die. The usual
load is 7000 lbs., placed on a waggon weighing
3000 lbs., and drawn by sixteen or eighteen oxen.
The cost for oxen averages about 9<i>l.</i> each, but
during this war they went up to 18<i>l.</i>, and even
25<i>l.</i> Each waggon, with dissel-boom and yokes
complete, costs at least 180<i>l.</i> The cost of mules will
average 20<i>l.</i> each, and mule waggons 100<i>l.</i>, with
harness at 5<i>l.</i> for each animal.</p>

<p>The road, after crossing the river Tugela, crosses
no less than four streams, and before reaching
Ekowe passes through a broken bushy country.
On the 22nd, the day on which Isandula was attacked,
Colonel Pearson had a sharp engagement with the
enemy at a place called by the natives Inyezane,
about four or five miles beyond his camping-ground
of the 21st. Major Barrow had been sent forward
along a fertile valley which led to the Inyezane,
when Colonel Pearson received a despatch from him,
saying that he had selected a tolerably good place
for camping, which he had carefully guarded by
vedettes. On receiving this information the colonel
at once rode on to the spot, and although he did not
quite approve of the ground, as being too full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
bush for an outspan, he decided to allow the waggons
to be outspanned for two hours on account of
there being no water near at hand. This was done
to rest and feed the oxen, and to allow the men to
have their morning meal. About eight o'clock, just
as the waggons had begun to park, and while the
officers were busy in directing the posting of pickets,
scouts, and sentries, the advanced company of the
Native Contingent, which had been scouting in front
under Captain Hart, discovered the Zulus in force
rapidly advancing over the slopes and attempting to
gain the bushes on both flanks. They came on in
skirmishing and extended order in the finest style,
rushing from bush to bush in a steady but stealthy
manner until within 100 or 150 yards of the outposts.
Captain Hart's men, being in the open, had
to bear the brunt of a heavy fire, and not without
casualties, as they lost one officer, four non-commissioned
officers, and four privates almost at once.
These poor fellows, it is feared, were sacrificed, inasmuch
as they did not understand the order to
retire and seek cover, and concluded that it was
their duty to remain in the open. The Naval
Brigade was now ordered into action, and most
ably they acquitted themselves. Two 7-pounders
and two 24-pounder Naval Brigade rockets were
smartly brought into action on a knoll at the base
of the pass, but commanding the valley from which
the flank attack was made. Meanwhile two companies
of the Buffs and A and B companies of the
Naval Brigade opened a heavy and well-directed fire
upon the enemy, and effectually held him in check.
This coign of vantage was occupied by Colonel
Pearson, whence he directed the movements of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
troops during the fight. All this time the waggons
continued to park, and while the fire was kept up by
Commander Campbell, Lieutenant Lloyd, with his
guns, and Lieutenant Martin with the Buffs, two
other companies of the same regiment which had
been employed in guarding waggons were moved
down, ready to clear the bush as soon as it was well
shelled and swept with rockets and musketry.
Colonel Pearson selected Captain Macgregor to
undertake this duty, with the assistance of Captains
Harrison and Wyld, who, getting their men into
skirmishing order, and bringing their shoulders
gradually forward as steadily as if man&#339;uvring at a
field-day, sent the Zulu braves flying discomfited
before them, and exposed them once more in the
open to the hail of shot and shell which swept the
plain. Colonel Welman, 99th Regiment, now took
advantage of this favourable moment, when the
enemy was demoralized, to send forward Captain
Wynne and Major Barrow with the infantry. These,
with skirmishers and flankers on the left, and supported
by two half-companies of the Buffs and 99th,
now moved forward at a steady pace.</p>

<p>The Zulus, however, were not beaten, though
evidently puzzled, and Campbell, who was in charge
of the Naval Brigade, saw that they were making a
flank movement on the left. This officer at once
obtained permission from Colonel Pearson to take a
portion of his men and drive out a body of Zulus
who had obtained possession of a kraal about 400
yards from the knoll. Captain Hart, with part of
his Native Contingent, gallantly supported this movement.
They managed to obtain possession of the
high ground to the left of the Ekowe road, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
effectually checked the enemy in their movement on
the British left.</p>

<p>But the gallant sailor Campbell was not satisfied
with this partial success, and sent for further permission
to follow up his <i>coup</i> by driving on the foe
to a more respectable distance. Colonel Parnell,
of the Buffs, who up to this time had been acting as
a sort of reserve with Captain Foster's company at
the foot knoll, where Colonel Pearson remained
throughout the action, had now an opportunity of
mingling in the fray. Smartly deploying his men,
he advanced at the double, and forming up on the
right of the bluejackets, swept the heights beyond
the kraal which a few moments before were crowned
with savage warriors. This decided the action, as
the Zulus, thoroughly distracted, fled in all directions,
the guns making capital practice wherever
a group collected. The last round from the rocket-tubes
seemed to carry destruction and confusion
amongst them, and was fired a little before ten a.m.</p>

<p>Colonel Pearson and Colonel Parnell both
had their horses shot under them, and several
officers remarked that the fire of the Zulus was
principally directed at the English leaders. The
regiments opposed to Pearson were composed of the
Umxapu, Umdhlanefu, and Ingulubi, and as near as
could be judged, and from the information subsequently
received, numbered about 5000 men. Of
these at the very least 300 were slain, while the
number of wounded, as a rule carried away into
the bush, could not have been less than double
that. Pearson's loss was eight killed and sixteen
wounded, and of these were six officers and non-commissioned
officers of the Native Contingent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
The following day two companies of the Buffs,
two companies Native Contingent, and a few
mounted men were sent off to the help of Colonel
Ely, 99th Regiment, who with three companies of
his regiment was bringing up a convoy, much
wanted, of seventy waggons of stores and ammunition,
while on Saturday, the 18th, Major Coates started
with fifty extra waggons to bring up more supplies.
On the day after the Inyezane engagement Pearson
arrived at Ekowe. The position was a strong one,
and he immediately set to work to make it still
more formidable. Water was close to the fort,
and well under its fire.</p>

<p>At this juncture news of the Isandhlwana disaster
reached Colonel Pearson. After consultation
with his officers, he decided to remain where he
was, feeling confident that even without further
supplies or reinforcements he could hold his position
for at least a couple of months. All his
waggons came in safety to the fort except five,
which broke down and had to be abandoned. The
mounted men and Native Contingent were sent
back to save food, and there thus remained 1200
British troops, having 320 rounds per man.</p>

<p>The first failure in the carrying out of Lord
Chelmsford's plans occurred to No. 4 Column,
and proved the initial step to the crowning disaster
of Isandhlwana. The right centre column, which
should have operated simultaneously with Colonel
Wood's force, was unfortunately composed almost
entirely of natives, and these fellows did not succeed
in getting over at the point directed in orders. As
this column could not be brought over the river, a
portion of it was left behind to keep open communications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and guard the frontier, while the remainder,
under Colonel Durnford, was moved up to Rorke's
Drift to reinforce Colonel Glyn's command. The
following day (12th) Colonel Glyn had his first
brush with the enemy. Lord Chelmsford had
joined this column, and after crossing the Tugela
ordered out a reconnaissance by the Bashee Valley
and along the road leading to Izpizi. Glyn took
with him three companies of the 1st battalion 24th
and one battalion 3rd Regiment Natal Native Contingent,
while the mounted men, crossing the valley,
went rapidly along the road leading over the Ngudu
mountains, where high cliffs close in the gorge for
more than three miles. Cattle and armed Zulus
were seen on the heights, and some of the 24th and
the natives were ordered to bear round to the right
flank and cut them off. The skirmish which followed
lasted about twenty minutes, and was a very
smart affair. It resulted in the taking of the fastnesses
and the precipitate flight of the Zulus, who
suffered a loss of ten killed, three wounded, and
nine prisoners taken, together with a quantity of
cattle, horses, and sheep. Colonel Glyn's loss was
two privates Natal Contingent killed, one officer of the
same, Lieutenant Purvis, severely wounded; Corporal
Mayer, Natal Native Contingent, severe wound in
thigh. Four companies of the 2nd battalion 24th,
and four companies of the 2nd battalion 3rd
Regiment Natal Native Contingent, under Colonel
Degacher, were now ordered by the General to
advance up the Bashee and attack Usirayo's kraal,
a place called Loxie, about two or three miles
farther on. This place, situated in a wild and
mountainous gorge or krantz, interspersed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
caves, guarded by huge boulders, was completely
explored by these men. In the meantime Russell
and his mounted men had ascended to the summit
of the Ngudu mountain, where they were fired upon
at a distance of 90 or 100 yards. Sixteen of the
Zulus were killed, and a very heavy thunderstorm
came on during the fight. No signs could be
observed of any Zulu force in reserve, and this was
explained by the subsequent news that Usirayo had
made a precipitate flight in the direction of the
king's kraal. On the following day communications
were opened between Wood's column and that
of Colonel Glyn. The General's movements from
the first appear to have been hampered by baggage
and transport arrangements, and a similar reason
delayed Colonel Pearson. Lord Chelmsford was
present with this column when it moved from
Rorke's Drift, and saw the site which was chosen
by Colonel Glyn at Insalwana, ten miles on the road
to the Indeni forest. He then left Colonel Glyn in
charge of the camp, and on the same day moved,
with a portion of the force, ten miles further on, to
reconnoitre the country in front. Returning to
camp that evening, without having had time to
fully explore, the General, the following morning,
sent out two separate reconnoitring columns, under
the command respectively of Major Dartnell, who
took with him the Mounted Police and Natal Volunteers,
of which he is commandant, and Commandant
Lonsdale with two battalions of his Native Contingent.
Dartnell went along the same road as
that explored by the General the previous day,
while Lonsdale moved along the southern slope of
the Inhlazatye range, towards a hill called Malaka's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Kop. If possible a junction between these two
bodies was to be effected; and, as soon as information
could be obtained as to the situation of the
enemy and the strategical features of the locality,
both were to return to the headquarter camp. By
some extraordinary oversight, neither of these reconnoitring
columns seems to have been supplied
with rations, while it was usual on such expeditions
for the men to take preserved meat and three days'
biscuit in their haversacks, supposing that mule
transport cannot be had. On the afternoon of the
Tuesday Major Dartnell sent an officer to the headquarter
camp, to inform the General that he could
not advance beyond the Insangu river, a small
stream near Inkankla Mountain, as the Zulus were
posted there in force. Dartnell, therefore, sent an
orderly to call up Lonsdale with his Native Contingent,
and sent to Lord Chelmsford to request
a reinforcement of regulars to enable him to
attack the enemy. His lordship did not consider
it advisable to comply with this demand, as the
daylight was almost gone, and the distance was
long. A supply of biscuit was, however, sent out
to the exploring party, who bivouacked at the foot
of the Inhlazatye. During the night, however,
Major Dartnell appears to have become aware of
his critical position, and at half-past two on the
morning of the 22nd (Wednesday), Colonel Glyn
received a letter from him, saying that the Zulus
had been strongly reinforced, and were now in his
front in great strength. Instead of recalling the
column, or at once pushing forward troops to its
assistance, a delay took place, and a staff officer was
despatched to ask Dartnell what he wished done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
After some further lapse of time the General
ordered Colonel Glyn to march to Major Dartnell's
assistance with the 2nd battalion 24th Regiment,
consisting of six companies, the mounted infantry,
and four of Harness's guns. As this detachment
would considerably weaken the camp, the General
at the same time sent off two expresses to Colonel
Durnford, who had been left at Rorke's Drift, telling
him to move up at once to Isandula with his 500
native troops, 250 of whom were mounted. The
General then decided to accompany Colonel Glyn's
force, and Lieutenant-Colonel Pulleine, 1-24th, was
left in charge of the camp, with orders to defend
it, pending the arrival of Durnford's natives. The
actual fighting strength of Pulleine's force consisted
of 2 officers, 78 men, and 2 guns R.A.; 1-24th
Regiment, 15 officers, 334 men; 2-24th Regiment,
5 officers, 90 men; mounted Europeans, 5 officers,
204 men; Native Contingent, 19 officers, 391 men;
Natal Pioneers, 1 officer, 10 men; while Durnford,
when he arrived very soon after, brought with him
18 officers and 450 men, thus making an aggregate
of 772 Europeans and 850 natives, or in all 1622
combatants. On his arrival at the camp, Colonel
Durnford, being the senior officer, of course immediately
assumed the command.</p>

<p>To the right understanding of what follows it is
necessary to give a somewhat detailed account of
the situation. The leading feature of the plain on
the southern slopes of which the English camp was
placed is the Isandhlwana, or Lion Hill. To the
west it rises abruptly, forming the head of the
crouching animal it resembles in shape; after forming
the back it descends sharply to the east. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
both ends are necks or ridges connecting the hill
with the smaller undulations of which the more
level part of the country consists. The road from
Rorke's Drift passes over the western ridge, while
on the north facing the camp was a deep ravine and
watercourse. To the immediate right was a small
copse; beyond this the ground was much broken,
irregular krantzes and hills all covered with huge
boulders continuing as far as the Buffalo river. To
the left of the camp, at the distance of rather more
than a mile, ran a long ridge towards the south,
connecting it with the great Isandhlwana hill,
having on its summit a plateau which, towards the
east, opened on to an open and extensive valley.
On the extreme left of the camp, looking towards
the ridge, were pitched the tents of the Natal
Native Contingent; between these and the next
two battalions intervened a space of rather less
than 300 yards; occupying the centre were the
British regular Infantry, just above whom came the
headquarters camp of Lord Chelmsford, and in close
proximity the headquarters of the column. On the
right were the guns and mounted corps lining the
edge of the road. Soon after it came over the neck
at the back of the camp the ground rose considerably,
until the bottom of the precipitous Isandhlwana
was reached: the camp therefore literally
had its back to a wall.</p>

<p>At six a.m. on the 22nd, a company of the Natal
Natives was ordered to scout towards the left, the
enemy having appeared in that direction. Whilst
these were away Durnford arrived, about nine
o'clock, with a rocket battery under Colonel Russell,
R.A., 250 mounted natives, and 250 native foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
News was now brought in that the Zulus in very
large numbers were driving the pickets before them.
A later messenger&mdash;a native without uniform, supposed
by some to be a Zulu purposely sent with
false intelligence&mdash;brought the news that the Zulus
had divided into three columns, one of which it was
supposed was about to attack Colonel Durnford's
baggage, still on the road from Rorke's Drift, the
other to harass Lord Chelmsford and Colonel Glyn's
party in their rear, whilst the third was to hover
round and watch the camp. Finally came the news
"Zulus retiring in all directions." Colonel Durnford
thereupon asked Colonel Pulleine to lend him
a couple of the 24th companies, but he declined,
saying his orders were to guard the camp, and he
could not, under the circumstances, let them go
without a positive command. Durnford then determined
to go on with his own force, which he
divided into three, one part being sent up the hill
to the left (east), one to the left front, and the third
to the rear, in the direction of Rorke's Drift, to act
as an escort for the baggage not yet arrived. The
rocket battery was of the party that proceeded to
the front under Colonel Durnford in person, to a
distance of four or five miles from the camp, but
being unable to keep pace with the mounted force
was soon left behind.</p>

<p>The body of troops despatched to the left became
engaged with the enemy almost immediately, and
firing was soon heard all along the crest of the hill.
In about an hour Durnford's mounted men re-appeared
over the hills, hotly pursued by swarms of
Zulus; at the same time the horsemen to the front
were also driven back. These, after retiring steadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in skirmishing order for about two miles, came
upon the remains of the rocket battery, which had
been cut off and broken up, whilst a hand to hand
engagement was going on with those who remained.
It appears that Russell, whilst advancing with his
battery, perceived a body of the enemy on his left,
he fired three rockets with some effect; then the
Zulus fired a volley, upon which the Native Contingent
of infantry retreated, the mules were frightened,
and disorder ensued. Taking advantage of
this, the enemy charged down the hill, a <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>
ensued, and Russell was killed. As the mounted
men retired towards them, the Zulus retreated to
their cover, and they, after making a final stand in
a spruit about a mile and a half in front of the
camp, were eventually driven in.</p>

<p>As the cavalry on the left was being pushed
rapidly back, Captain Mostyn was ordered to
advance with two companies of 1-24th on the
eastern neck of the Isandhlwana, where at a distance
of about a mile and a half the Zulus were
advancing in large numbers along the north of the
Isandhlwana, to outflank the camp on the right,
and with this wing of the foe they at once became
engaged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Zulu left rapidly, and the centre
steadily, though more slowly, pushed forward,
despite the artillery fire poured into them. Orders
were now given for three companies of the 1-24th
to occupy ground near the Native Contingent
camp, facing the hill over which the Zulu force
was streaming. These three companies were supported
to their right front by the Natal Native
Contingent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately to the right of the Native Contingent
tents came the guns, at a distance of about four
hundred yards from the left, and rather more from
the right, which was composed of two companies,
24th Regiment and the Mounted Corps, and which
occupied the extreme right of the camp and rested
on the road. The infantry, in extended order, were
by this time engaged along the whole line, and were
firing rapidly and steadily. Though the enemy fell
in hundreds they kept advancing in apparently
undiminished numbers. As rank after rank of the
foremost were swept down others pressed on, till at
length the companies of the 1-24th above mentioned
had been driven back to within 300 yards of that
portion of the camp occupied by the Native Contingent.
A number of the native infantry now
began a hasty retreat to the camp; their officers
endeavoured to restrain them, but without effect.
Captain Essex pointed this out to Colonel Durnford,
who ordered him to take men to that portion of the
field, and endeavour to hold the enemy in check.
But before this could be executed the natives rushed
back in the utmost disorder, thus laying open the
right and rear of the companies of the first battalion
of the 24th on the left and rear, and the enemy
dashing forward at once poured in through this part
of the line. In a moment all was disorder, and but
few had time to fix bayonets before the Zulus were
amongst them, using their assegais with terrible
effect. Then followed a scene of utter confusion;
horse and foot, black and white, English and Zulu,
friend and foe, in a struggling, fighting crowd,
pushed gradually through the camp towards the
road, where the Zulu right already barred the way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Every man endeavoured to escape towards the
Buffalo river, but this was almost an impossibility
even for mounted men. The ground was rugged,
broken with water-washes, boulder-strewn: ground
over which an active native Zulu could progress
even faster than a horse. In front ran the river,
swift, deep, and fordless, sharp rocks, and deep
water alternating. Not half of those who escaped
from the camp succeeded in crossing this obstacle:
many were drowned, many assegaied, some few
shot, and so the pursuit continued right into Natal.
The guns moved from right to left across the camp,
and endeavoured to get on the Rorke's Drift road.
This being occupied by the enemy, they turned off
to the left, and coming to grief in a donga had to
be abandoned. Major Smith, though wounded,
managed to reach the Buffalo, but was there shot.</p>

<p>Lieuts. Melvill and Coghill, seeing all was lost,
made an attempt to escape on horseback with the
colours of the 24th. Coghill succeeded in getting
safely across the Buffalo, but Melvill was struck
by a shot just as he was reaching the far bank of
the river. Coghill, with heroic devotion, turned
back to assist his less fortunate comrade&mdash;alas!
only to share his fate. Their bodies were subsequently
discovered in close proximity, and around
them a group of dead Zulus. The colours which
they had so desperately defended were also found in
the bed of the river, saved from the degradation of
capture and contamination by the hands of savages.</p>

<p>In this sad affair there perished twenty-six Imperial
officers and 600 non-commissioned officers and men.
The loss of the Colonial forces was not less terrible,
twenty-four officers being included in the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a detailed list of the victims of
that sad day:&mdash;1-24th, Col. Pulleine, Major White;
Captains Degacher, Wardell, Mostyn, Younghusband;
Lieuts. Hodson, Cavaye, Atkinson, Daly,
Anstey, Porteous, Melvill, Quarter-Master Pullen,
and five entire companies: 2-24th, Lieuts. Pope,
Austin, Dyer, Griffiths, Quarter-Master Bloomfield,
and ninety men. Royal Engineers, Colonel Durnford,
Lieut. McDowell, Captain G. Shepstone
(political assistant to Col. Durnford), Lieut. Coghill,
A.D.C. (to Sir Bartle Frere), Surgeon-Major Shepherd.
The Mounted Police Carabineers and Volunteers
lost forty-three out of seventy-one, including
Captain Bradstreet, Lieut. F. J. D. Scott, and Quarter-Master
Hitchcock. The Mounted Infantry lost
thirty out of thirty-four. The N Battery 5th Brigade,
Royal Artillery, under Major Stuart Smith, was
destroyed (Lieut. Curling escaped), as also the
Rocket Battery under Major Russell, R.A. 1st
Battalion 3rd Regiment, N.N.C., lost in officers,
Captains Robert Krohn and James Lonsdale, Lieuts.

Quarter-Master John McCormick. 2nd Battalion
3rd Regiment, N.N.C., lost Captains Erskine, Barry,
and Murray; Lieuts. Pritchard, Young, Gibson,
Standish Vereker, and Rivers, Quarter-Master A.
Chambers. The loss of material is put down at
102 waggons, 1400 oxen, 2 guns, 400 shot and
shell, 1200 rifles, 250,000 rounds of rifle ammunition,
60,000<i>l.</i> worth of commissariat supplies, a
rocket trough, and a number of tents.</p>

<p>Four special-service officers, viz. Captain Alan
Gardner, 14th Hussars and Essex 75th Regiment,
and Lieuts. Smith, Dorien, 95th, and Cochrane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
32nd, together with Lieut. Curling, R.A., succeeded
in escaping, and rode away to Helpmakaar, where a
laager was immediately formed. The same night,
as no other messenger could be found, and it was
feared Wood's column might be cut off in rear,
Captain Gardner started to give him timely warning.
Riding all night, he reached Utrecht about four
o'clock next day, thence despatching a messenger to
Colonel Wood, he himself returned to Helpmakaar.</p>

<p>The following account is of great interest as
having been given by a Zulu deserter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Zulu army, consisting of the Ulundi corps
about 3000 strong, the Nokenke 2000, the Nkobamakosi,
including the Uve, 5000 strong, the
Umcityu 4000 strong, the Nodwengu 2000 strong,
the Umbonambi 3000, and the Udkloko 1000&mdash;a
total of 20,000 men in all&mdash;after an address from
the king left the Nodwengu military kraal on January
17th, and proceeded on their march towards
Rorke's Drift. On the 20th they halted for the
night close by the Isipezi hill, and on the 21st,
keeping to the eastward, they occupied a valley
running north and south under the spurs of the
Ngutu hill, which concealed that of Isandhlwana,
distant about four miles nearly due west. The order
of encampment was&mdash;on the right, the Nodwengu,
Nokenke and Umcityu; in the centre, the Nkobamakosi
and Umbonambi; on the left, the Ulundi and
Udkloko corps. On the morning of the 22nd there
was no intention of making an attack on account of
some superstition as to the state of the moon, and
they were sitting down resting when firing was
heard by the Zulus on the right. This was at first
supposed by them to be an attack on the centre, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
move being made in that direction this proved not
to be the case; and it was soon found out that this
was the whites engaged with Matyana's people some
ten miles off to the left front. Just after the Zulus
had resumed their position, and again sat down, a
herd of cattle came past their line driven down by
some of their scouts from the right. Just when
these were opposite the Umcityu regiment a body of
mounted men on the hill to the west were seen
galloping and evidently trying to cut them off.
When several hundred yards off, seeing the Umcityu,
they dismounted, fired a volley, and retired. The
Umcityu at once jumped up and charged. This example
was followed by the Nokenke and Nodwengu
on the right, as well as by the Nkobamakosi and
Umbonambi in the centre, whilst the Undi and
Udkloko formed a circle&mdash;as is customary with the
Zulus when a force is about to engage&mdash;and remained
in their position. With these were the two
chief officers Mavamingwana and Tyugwayo, who
after a short pause led away these centre troops in a
north-westerly direction, and keeping to the north of
the Isandhlwana performed a turning movement,
unseen by the English through the nature of the
ground. Thus the original Zulu left became the
extreme right, the right the centre, and the centre
the left. The two regiments forming the latter&mdash;the
Nkobamakosi and Umbonambi&mdash;made a
turning movement along the front of the camp to
the English right, but became engaged before they
could complete it. The Uve battalion of the Nkobamakosi
had to retire till reinforced; and the
Umbonambi suffered heavily from the artillery fire.
Meanwhile the Zulu centre, consisting of the Umcityu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
(left centre) and Nokenke and Nodwengu (higher up
on the right) under the hill, were making a direct
attack on the left of the camp. The Umcityu
suffered very severely from both artillery and musketry
fire; the Nokenke from musketry fire alone;
while the Nodwengu suffered least. When the
camp was carried the regiments became all mixed up
together; some pursued the fugitives to the Buffalo;
the remainder plundered the camp: but the Undi
and Udkloko made the best of their way to Rorke's
Drift, in order to plunder the post there."</p>

<p>It is now time to turn attention to the remainder
of the troops that had left the camp before this sad
event occurred.</p>

<p>The force under Colonel Glyn, accompanied by
Lord Chelmsford, moved off at early dawn, and had
reached Major Dartnell by 6.15 a.m. The General
at once took command, and ordered out scouting
parties of mounted men to gain intelligence of the
positions and strength of the enemy, who soon after
showed in some force on the opposing heights parallel
to the Inhlazatye Mountains. A general advance of
the troops was made, and the enemy retired slowly,
but without firing. The guns and 24th Regiment
meanwhile moved up the valley, their left being
protected by the Mounted Infantry, while the
Mounted Police and Volunteers guarded the right
flank. The main body of the enemy drew back in
regular order and took up a position with great skill
on the spurs of the Isipisi Mountain, distant about
six miles, but Captain Shepstone, with his Natal
Carabineers, managed to cut off about 300 of the
stragglers and destroyed fifty of them. At nine
a.m. a messenger, whose horse was panting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
covered with foam, arrived before Colonel Glyn with
a brief despatch from Colonel Pulleine, notifying
that musketry firing was heard on the left front of
the camp. Lord Chelmsford at once sent a staff
officer, Lieutenant Milne, to an eminence from
whence the camp and valley of Insalwana could be
seen, and it seems that a delay of an hour took place
while this officer was vainly scanning the horizon.
The actual scene of conflict where Colonel Durnford
was engaged with the Zulu army was five miles
away, and hidden by some hills intervening between
Lord Chelmsford's position and the British camp.
The General, therefore, seems to have felt no apprehensions
in regard to the safety of the camp, and
continued his operations against the supposed main
body of the Zulus.</p>

<p>About two o'clock Lord Chelmsford was on the
banks of the Amange stream, selecting a fit spot for
a camp, he having already in the morning sent Captain
Gardner back to Colonel Pulleine with an order
to that officer to forward the camping materials of
the party out on reconnaissance. While thus engaged
a native on horseback galloped down from the
opposite ridge saying that an attack was being made
on the camp, and that he had seen heavy firing and
heard the big guns. Lord Chelmsford immediately
hastened to the crest of the hill, whence through a
glass the camp could be plainly seen. All, however,
seemed quiet: the sun was shining on the white
tents; no signs of firing were seen, and the bodies
of men moving about in the camp were put down to
be English soldiers and friendly natives. Knowing
how careful were his dispositions and how positive
his orders for the defence of the camp, one and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of Lord Chelmsford's escort came to the conclusion
that an attack had been made and repulsed. It was
then decided that the headquarters camp should
move to the spot selected on the Amange stream,
whilst the General himself, who was anxious to know
the details of the attack, should proceed back to
camp. The Carabineers and the Mounted Infantry
accompanied him: the 1st battalion 24th Regiment,
the four guns, the Mounted Police and 2nd battalion
of 3rd Regiment Native Contingent were left to form
the new camp. During the first seven miles of the
journey nothing occurred to excite the General's suspicion.
Certainly some of the tents had disappeared,
but then this was in accordance with the orders
given in the morning. When about four miles from
the camp he fell in with the Natal Native Contingent,
which had been ordered to return many hours previously,
but which seeing the camp attacked by
forces superior to its own had wisely halted. In
about half-an-hour they were met by a solitary
horseman coming at a foot pace from the direction
of the camp. Commandant Lonsdale, for it was
he, rode up to the General and uttered the astounding
words "The camp is in possession of the enemy."
It appears that Lonsdale, who had been ill, being
very tired was quietly returning from Glyn's column
to the camp. He had crossed the small water-wash
to the south of the camp and was jogging slowly
along in a sort of lethargy, from which he was roused
by the discharge of a rifle close to him. Looking up,
he saw a native, who had evidently just fired, and
him he imagined to be one of his own contingent
indulging in reckless firing; so he pursued his way.
Sitting in and around the tents were groups of red-coats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
so he still kept on till within a bare ten yards of
the tents. He then saw a great black Zulu come out
of one with a blood-besmeared assegai in his hand.
Gazing more carefully, he saw that black men, and
black men only, were the wearers of the red-coats.
The truth flashed on him: turning his pony sharp
round he galloped off before the enemy knew what
he was about. Not less than 150 shots were fired
at him as he did so, but, providentially, he escaped
to warn the General, who, without such warning,
his staff and troops with him, would have walked
unsuspiciously into the trap, and the whole force
would probably have perished to a man.</p>

<p>The General at once sent back to hurry up
Colonel Glyn and his force, while Colonel Russell
was sent on to reconnoitre the camp, which was
found to be as Commandant Lonsdale had reported.
On Colonel Glyn's arrival the whole force was disposed
in fighting order, and moved rapidly across
the plain, but could not arrive in the vicinity of the
camp until after dark. All was found a wreck&mdash;corpses,
broken tents, dead horses, oxen, and other
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> were strewed around; and the men, most of
whom were without ammunition, and had not tasted
food for forty-eight hours, were ordered to bivouac
amidst the crowd of blood-stained relics which
marked the day's slaughter. Our soldiers had
covered more than thirty miles on the previous day
without food or ammunition, and if resolutely
attacked by the entire force of Zulus might have
shared the fate of their comrades. The next morning,
therefore, before daylight a sad retreat was
effected to Rorke's Drift, where the first glad tidings
were heard of the glorious defence which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
made by Chard and Bromhead, with their handful
of men.</p>

<p>It came about thus. Lieutenant Chard, with one
sergeant and six men, had been left in charge of
the ponts over the Tugela at this point. Close by
was a commissariat dep&ocirc;t in charge of Lieutenant
Bromhead and a company of the 24th Regiment.
About three o'clock on January 22nd news of the
disaster at Isandhlwana reached this officer, together
with a note, saying that the enemy were
advancing in force against his post, which was to
be held at all costs. Chard immediately withdrew
his small party, and in concert with Bromhead
arranged for the loopholing and barricading the
store-building and hospital, and for connecting the
defences of the two by building walls of mealie-bags.
At 3.30 an officer of Durnford's Horse with
about 100 men came in, and was asked to send
them out as vedettes; these, when pressed, to fall
back and assist in the defence of the buildings. At
4.30 this officer returned with the news that the
enemy was close at hand, that his men would not
obey orders, but had galloped off to Helpmakaar.
About the same time Captain Stephenson and his
detachment of natives also withdrew. It was at
once perceived that the line of defence was now
too extended for the small force left, and an inner
entrenchment of biscuit-boxes was made, and this
had been completed to a wall two boxes high, when
suddenly 600 of the enemy turned the hill to the
south. They advanced at a run against the southern
wall, and notwithstanding a tremendous fire reached
to within fifty yards of it. Being here encountered
by a cross-fire from the store they were stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Taking advantage, however, of some shelter afforded
by the cookhouse and ovens, they kept up heavy
musketry volleys thence, whilst the main body
moved on to the left round the hospital, whence
they made a rush upon the north-west wall and
breastwork of mealie-bags. Meanwhile the mass of
the advancing foe lined a ledge of rocks and filled
the caves overlooking the English position at a
distance of 100 yards to the south, whence they too
kept up a constant fire. Another party to the left
occupied a garden in a hollow in the road, and also
the bush beyond, which time had not permitted to
be cut down. The enemy could thus advance close
to the English works, and were soon in possession
of one whole side of the wall, whilst on the other in
a line extending from the hospital all along the wall
to the bush they made a series of determined onsets.
But each attack was met and splendidly repulsed
with the bayonet, Corporal Schiess (N.N.C.) especially
distinguishing himself. The fire from the
ledge of rock and caves at length became so galling,
that it was necessary to retire behind the inner line
of biscuit-boxes.</p>

<p>All this time the enemy had been trying to force
the hospital, and at length they did set fire to the
roof. The garrison defended the place room by
room, bringing out all the sick who could be moved
before they retired. Privates Williams, Hook, R.
Jones, and W. Jones, 24th Regiment, were the last
to leave, holding the doorway against the Zulus
with their bayonets, their ammunition being quite
expended. Five sick men, owing to the smoke and
want of interior communication, had unfortunately
to be left to their fates. Two heaps of mealie-bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were now converted into a sort of redoubt, and a
second line of fire was thus obtained all round.
Darkness now came on, and after several more
furious attacks had been repulsed the defenders had
ultimately to retire to the middle, and then to the
inner wall of the kraal, east of the position they had
at first held. The attacks continued all night, the
soldiers firing with the utmost coolness, and never
wasting a shot. At four a.m., January 23rd, firing
ceased, and by daybreak the enemy were disappearing
over the hill to the south-west. The ground
was then patrolled, the arms of the dead Zulus
collected, and the position strengthened as far as
possible. About seven a.m. a large body of the enemy
was again seen on the hill to the south-west, and a
friendly Kaffir, who had come in shortly before,
was sent to Helpmakaar to ask for assistance.
However, about eight a.m. the British 3rd column
began to appear, whereupon the enemy, who had
been again advancing, fell back as the troops
advanced, and Rorke's Drift Post had been saved.</p>

<p>The number of English engaged in this action
was eight officers and 131 non-commissioned officers
and men; of these fifteen were killed and twelve
wounded, two subsequently dying of their hurts.
The attacking Zulu force consisted of two regiments&mdash;the
Undi and Udkloko&mdash;in all a total of something
less than 4000. Of these 370 lay dead around the
post on the morning that Lord Chelmsford so opportunely
arrived.</p>

<p>Surgeon Reynolds, Acting Commissary Officer
Dalton, and Assistant Commissary Dunne were
throughout conspicuous for their gallantry and coolness.
Lieutenants Chard, R.E., and Bromhead, 24th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Regiment, subsequently received the thanks of both
Houses of Parliament for their heroic conduct, and
were advanced to the rank of majors.</p>

<p>So much has been said and written as to the
cause of, and so many people have been held responsible
for the Isandhlwana disaster that the subject
cannot here be passed over in silence.</p>

<p>The living no less than the dead have a claim to
a full share of justice and truth; but remembering
that the mouths of one party&mdash;"les morts qui ne
reviennent pas"&mdash;are closed, we should be extremely
careful in drawing any conclusion from acts which,
could the testimony of the fallen be obtained, it
would not only explain and excuse, but amply
justify.</p>

<p>The court of inquiry held at Helpmakaar found
itself unable to form from the available evidence any
positive judgment; but the facts disclosed point
irresistibly to a negative conclusion. Had the
troops acted on the defensive, the camp would not
have been lost.</p>

<p>Still there may have been cogent&mdash;nay irresistible
reasons which caused Colonel Durnford to push
forward his forces. Were Colonel Pulleine alive, he
might give equally good reasons for acceding to
Durnford's urgent request and sending out the
reinforcements.</p>

<p>The British regular infantry advanced successfully,
retired slowly and in unbroken order; they
were still firing rapidly, coolly, and with great effect.
Things though desperate were by no means hopeless.
Suddenly the native levies, "though their
officers tried to restrain them, rushed back in the
utmost disorder," thus exposing the flank and rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the regulars. "Few of the men had time to fix
bayonets before the enemy were amongst them, using
their assegais with terrible effect." Here is the
answer to "How did it happen?" The natives on
one side&mdash;the Zulu&mdash;were regarded too lightly; on
the other, fighting for the English with too great
confidence. "Why," it will be asked, "were not
the waggons laagered? Whose duty was it to see
this done?" Lord Chelmsford had issued a standing
order at the very commencement of the campaign,
that this was to be the first consideration in all
camps. Lord Chelmsford, accompanied Colonel
Glyn from Rorke's Drift, saw the site chosen at
Isandhlwana, and then immediately started on a
reconnaissance which lasted till after nightfall.
Doubtless Lord Chelmsford supposed Colonel Glyn
had done what was necessary. On the following
morning with the first streak of dawn Colonel Glyn
was ordered to proceed to Major Dartnell's assistance,
and Lord Chelmsford determined to accompany
him, after despatching an express to Colonel
Durnford ordering him up "to strengthen the camp."
Doubtless Colonel Glyn supposed that Colonel Pulleine
would see to laagering the waggons. Colonel
Pulleine was in command of the camp a bare three
hours, and doubtless, knowing how brief his tenure
of office was to be, preferred to let things remain
as they were till his successor's arrival. Colonel
Durnford had not been a single half-hour in camp
before the action was commenced.</p>

<p>It is asked why did not the troops form squares?
Hastings, we are told, had Harold's men only
remained in their position, would have been a Saxon
victory&mdash;Torres Vedras a disgrace instead of a glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
had the British troops been rashly taunted into
leaving their trenches: and Waterloo a more glowing
theme for Beranger's lyre had Napoleon been
able to entice the patient English squares to forsake
their adamantine formation. But why was Colonel
Durnford to form squares? How was he to imagine
that such an immense force was arrayed against him
when the Commander-in-chief had with him a
superior force to that left in the camp avowedly to
operate against the enemy's main body? For such
his information and personal observation led him to
believe was the force against whom he and Major
Dartnell were acting.</p>

<p>Colonel Durnford was no novice in South African
war; like C&aelig;sar, he had the gift of the pen no less
than the sword; he had both written and fought
well. Colonel Pulleine was an experienced officer
of no mean reputation, and by whatever device they
were deceived, we may be sure that it was no
ordinary one, and that few would have stood where
they fell.</p>

<p>Again, who could have anticipated the attack?
We have it from the lips of a Zulu that the onset
was unpremeditated, and the result of accident.
With all humbleness, let it be confessed that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a divinity that shapes our ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rough hew them as we will."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another question, often asked, is, "Why did not
Lord Chelmsford, immediately on his return, make
a counter-attack on the enemy." First of all he had
to wait for Colonel Glyn and the main body to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
up to him. Meanwhile darkness had come on.
When Glyn arrived he did advance with his troops
formed up for action, and with the intention of re-taking
the camp, which he had every reason to
suppose was occupied by the enemy. The event
proved they had abandoned it. Was not this a
good reason for striking a blow? Let the facts of
the case be well borne in mind. Lord Chelmsford
knew that there was a large force in his rear; the
force that had sacked the camp was supposed, and
reasonably enough, to be on the right flank. In
front were the bright watchfires of another force,
and the blazing hospital at Rorke's Drift, which,
together with Helpmakaar, there was every ground
to believe had been captured and looted by the foe;
in a word, his force was surrounded. The men had
only fifty rounds of ammunition apiece; they had
been twenty-four hours without food; they were
physically exhausted by eighteen hours' continuous
marching, and no less morally by the loss of their
camp; their probabilities of escape were distant.
How could a general lead troops in such a condition
against a foe flushed and elated with spoil and
recent victory?</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">We</span> must now return to Pearson, whom we left
entrenching himself at Ekowe.</p>

<p>The position is a most commanding one, being
almost on the summit of the Tyoe range, and
more than 2000 feet above the sea level; and for
beauty of site could scarcely be surpassed. To
the north, about a mile and a half, is the
Umlalazi river, at that time rather full from the
late rains, and beyond this stream are long undulating
grassy plains, almost devoid of bush, with
the exception here and there of a few wild and
dwarf date-palms, and lichens in the hollows.
Behind, to the south, is the Umkukusi range, and
a hilly but open country, while on the west is a
very broken and difficult country, bounded by the
Hintza forest. Away to the east, right to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
coast at Port Durnford, is about forty miles of undulating
and here and there hilly country. About
1200 yards to the south-east there is a rocky
eminence at least 600 feet higher than the fort, and
from this place a magnificent view of Port Durnford
and the mouth of the Umlalazi can be seen.
The sea is not more than twenty-two miles off, in
a line as the crow flies. The original building was
formerly a Norwegian mission station, and when
the present war began it was abandoned by the
missionaries and plundered by the Zulus. The
buildings, when Pearson arrived, consisted of three
moderately-sized brick erections, thatched originally
with straw, but subsequently covered with a less
inflammable material. In addition to these buildings,
which were utilized as stores, there was a
small church, built of the native-made sun-dried
bricks, and covered, as most of these edifices are
in that country, with corrugated galvanized iron.
The church was turned into an hospital, while
the tower made a capital look-out, from whence
could be seen the next post, and which afterwards
proved of such service in the way of signalling.
Pearson now began to suffer the inconveniences of
a regular siege; his communications were cut, and
it was found that of the twelve messengers belonging
to the Natal Native Contingent sent from Ekowe
with letters during the first week in February, only
one arrived, the others having been intercepted and
killed on their way. The fort soon completely
changed its character under the incessant labour
bestowed upon it by Pearson's men, under the
vigilant supervision of their chief. It now became
a six-angled enclosure, about sixty yards wide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
having a ditch eighteen feet in depth, while its
breadth was twelve feet. At the bottom it was
studded profusely with assegai heads securely
planted, and the parapets, carefully rivetted, were
proof not only against any musketry fire, but field
artillery. From its southern angles ran out two
well-built curtain walls, enclosing a fine kraal for
cattle and horses. These curtains were well protected
by the fire of the angles from which they
sprung, while the kraal itself had its own massive
gateway and drawbridge. At the end of the kraal,
or cattle enclosure, furthest from the angular fort,
was constructed from the remains of a dilapidated
magazine, a kind of irregular redoubt, which also
had a deep ditch and thick mud walls, defended by
a quantity of powerful thorns laid along the parapet.
It was most fortunate that this force brought with
them a large supply of well-selected entrenching
tools, consisting of shovels, picks, spades, billhooks,
axes, and crowbars. Day by day, whenever their
time could be spared from patrol and outpost duty,
the men were employed in making entanglements of
rows of felled trees, as well as constructing fascines,
filling sandbags, turning out gabions, loopholes, and
<i>abattis</i>. All these obstacles possessed the usual
requisites. They were under the close fire of the
fort, were covered from the enemy's fire, and gave
him no cover; while they were all made so substantially
that they could not be cut down or removed
without immense difficulty. The piquet duties were
rather severe, and each piquet had to furnish two or
three double sentries in reliefs, patrols, and links.
They were posted under the best circumstances obtainable,
being sheltered from the enemy, having a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
range in front, with every advantage in retreating
if attacked in force. Each face or front of the fort
was cleared up to 800 yards; shelter trenches were
made for the first line of defence; cover was left for
the supports and reserves; ranges were marked and
measures taken for the artillery and rifle fire, and
all precautionary arrangements made in regard to
the supply and storage of provisions, forage, water,
and ammunition.</p>

<p>The water was good, and not brackish at that
time of the year. It was taken from a bright stream
well under the fire of the fort, and fed by a capital
spring, also under fire of one of the seven-pounders.
The church and the storehouses were also carefully
loopholed, and sandbags furnished to make the
defences more secure. These three strong loopholed
buildings, forming part of the <i>enceinte</i>, were
rendered more formidable by double planking,
backed crossways by iron barrel hoops, while fine,
damp, heavy sand from the neighbouring hill was
employed in filling bags, made from old provision
sacks.</p>

<p>Every man in the fort had his proper place
assigned to him, and at exercise it was found that
with three minutes' notice each detachment was in
its place. The Buffs were told off to the two
northern faces, on which side there was a well-made
<i>caponni&egrave;re</i> thrown up in the re-entering angle. At
the west angle of this fort one gun and a detachment
of the Royal Artillery were posted, while on
the east salient were two guns and a somewhat
stronger number of men. Here there was a small
outlet for water-parties, guarded on the flank by a
little loopholed building, and commanded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rear by a strong building with a thatched roof. The
rocket tubes were placed under charge of the Royal
Marines, on the south-west front, and could, if
necessary, sweep the trek oxen laager, and slaughter
oxen laager outside the fort on that side. The
principal gateway was on the west face, and was
guarded by a company of the Buffs, who loopholed
the church tower in their rear to fall back upon,
and to act as a commanding flanking fire. The
front, facing due south, was served by the 99th,
with one gun at the salient angle, a <i>caponni&egrave;re</i> in
the centre, guarded by a Gatling, and with a thirteen
feet stockade at the opposing angle. Another
strong building, also thatch roof, commanded this
front. Not a day passed but some improvement
was made in strengthening these works, and this as
much for prudence against possible attack, as to
keep the men occupied and free from the lassitude
attendant upon long confinement. It should also
be mentioned that torpedoes had been laid down by
the bluejackets for three miles along the bed of the
Tugela, so that if the Zulus attempted to cross near
any of the posts of observation they might be somewhat
astonished.</p>

<p>The ration daily used to be two pounds of beef&mdash;fresh
killed and tough as leather&mdash;a couple of commissariat
biscuits&mdash;hard as flint&mdash;a very small complement
of coffee or tea, sugar, and one spoonful of
lime juice, which every man had to take whether he
liked it or not; preserved potatoes, compressed
vegetables, and an occasional ration of beans, made
a little variety now and then. During the last days
of the siege the meat and biscuit ration was reduced.
A day's routine was as follows:&mdash;The men rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with the <i>r&eacute;veille</i> at four a.m. for a parade of all
hands and fatigue duties for a couple of hours,
weather permitting: the breakfast bugle sounded at
eight, and fatigues were again performed from 9.30
till noon; dinner bugle at 1.30, and rest and recreation
till 4.30, and finally "retreat" at 6.30, when
no one was to be outside the walls. The men
amused themselves with quoits, cricket, and athletics,
some of the Buffs being good "all round;"
while all the officers, especially the colonel, encouraged
these pastimes by example as well as precept.
After all, the life was not more monotonous than
that on board ship. There was no lack of ammunition,
as Colonel Ely on march to Ekowe had to
abandon only ten waggons, and these were looted.
The rest, however, arrived safely. The garrison
also from time to time received valuable and most
reassuring information regarding the disposition
and whereabouts of their friends along the line of
the Tugela, and in their rear. At Fort Pearson,
which might be said to be the principal base of
operations, and which commanded the river and
lower drift from the Natal side, there were sufficient
men of the Naval Brigade to work the two guns
there. They had also the European officers and the
non-commissioned officers of the disbanded native
corps. Then, to keep up communications, the
Mounted Volunteers of Coast District were posted
at intervals along the river, between Fort Pearson
and Kranz Kop. Another fort on the Zulu bank of
the Tugela was called "Fort Tenedos," in compliment
to the detachment which formed its garrison.
Major Barrow, with a squadron of mounted
infantry, and Lieutenant Kingscote, with a smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
body of marines and bluejackets, formed the defensive
force. At Rorke's Drift there were now five
companies of the 2nd battalion of the 24th Regiment.
A strongly entrenched position had also been formed
on a commanding site called Macdonald's Farm, on
a rocky eminence overlooking the Tugela. Ditches
ten feet deep were cut, parapets seven feet high
thrown up, the farmhouse itself strengthened,
and all the garden walls loopholed. The garrison
consisted of the Stanger Mounted Rifles, and some
native auxiliaries, who proved most trustworthy as
scouts and messengers. Captain Lucas, whose
admirable powers of organization were quite proverbial
amongst the colonists, and whose frontier
experiences were of long standing, was strongly
posted at a bend of the river between the farm and
Thring's Post, and had with him a useful body of
natives. Thring's Post came next on the list, and
here there were a couple of hundred of well-mounted
and well-armed volunteers divided into
squadrons, or corps of fifty men. Thring's Post is
on the Imyamazana Mountain, and is about twenty-seven
miles from Fort Pearson. The volunteers,
knowing the country well, were employed in keeping
up by constant patrols communications with
Fort Pearson and Fort Cherry.</p>

<p>News also reached them that Wood had been
reinforced, and was more than holding his own.
There was, therefore, little anxiety felt for the
security of the frontier, and everything strengthened
Colonel Pearson in his determination to remain in
his position instead of attempting to cut his way
out.</p>

<p>The health of the Ekowe garrison continued very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
good. The hospital, it has been said, was the old
church of the mission-station. At the end of the
second week in March there were only twenty-five
men on the sick-list, and many of these almost convalescent.
They had, however, lost two of their
number lately, namely, poor Williams of the Buffs,
and another great favourite, young Coker, the mid-shipman,
who fought his Gatling so well at Inyanezi.
Both these fine fellows were ill but a short time, and
succumbed to fever. They were buried with the
usual honours just outside the fort.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rowden, 98th Regiment, who was
nominated by Colonel Pearson commander of the
mounted scouts, performed his difficult and dangerous
task to perfection. He had by the end of
February successfully explored the country in the
direction of the Isangweni military kraal, which
was not far from Ondini, and about three miles from
Ekowe. He reported that there were 1500 men
there, and more collecting. The 1500 were composed
of the married regiment Isangu, whose
average age is fifty-four, and whose services in
former wars had been most distinguished. The
country between the fort and Isangweni was an
undulating table-land, running parallel to the forests
on either side, and admirably suited for cavalry.
Another brother of Cetywayo, named Dabulamanzi,
had a fortified kraal not far from that of Isangweni,
and Pearson determined to attack both those places
as soon as he was in a position to move upon them.</p>

<p>The second week of March had now come to an
end, and it was deemed advisable to vary the monotony
of life in the fort by one or two offensive
expeditions. The most important of these, both as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to the numbers engaged and its effects, was the
foray on Dabulamanzi's kraal. The forces detailed
for this expedition consisted of fifty men of the Buffs,
the same number of the 99th, and twenty-five of the
Naval Brigade, with their Gatling, and a small body of
mounted scouts, under the active Lieutenant Rowden
(98th). Starting about five a.m., the party descended
the slopes that led to the river, and continued
its march along a valley running north-east,
and gradually narrowing. The track in some places
was crossed by difficult spruits, and was scarcely
defined; but their guides were well acquainted with
the landmarks, although the pathways were often
obliterated by thorns and bush. The track was also
frequently commanded by spurs and bluffs projecting
overhead, but these were carefully explored by
the mounted men, and no enemy could be seen. A
considerable watershed was reached about eight
miles from Ekowe, and here, in a favourable and
secluded position, was made the first off-saddle for
half an hour. The country about here was entirely
denuded of fodder, but the horsemen had been fortunately
directed to bring a few mealies for their
mounts. On resuming the march they crossed the
bottom of a deep sandy nullah with very precipitous
sides, which they were forced to follow, as it was the
only practicable track. About a mile and a half
further on the advanced patrols sent back to inform
the officer of the main body that there was a camping-ground
or temporary kraal about three miles
and a half north, where there was sufficient water
and grass. The orders were therefore given to push
on for this point, and in about forty-five minutes it
was reached. It was now sundown, and their chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
having decided that it was inexpedient to march
during the night, orders were issued for the usual
precautions to be taken, and to bivouac till daybreak.</p>

<p>During the night, however, no one slept, as they
had several alarms, and it became evident from certain
indications known to the experienced in Zulu
camping-out, that they were being reconnoitred by
the enemy, though in all probability not in sufficient
force to deliver an attack. As, however, it was
quite possible that messengers would be despatched
to the neighbouring kraals, it was deemed advisable
to strengthen the position, in case of their being
surrounded before the morning. Taking one of the
guides, who said he knew the neighbourhood, from
having frequently hunted here, one of the officers
and a couple of men were sent to make a reconnaissance
round the bivouac. This party at once started
without making any noise, and entering on the old
watercourse worked their way up towards the summit
of the kloof. Large, indeed enormous, blocks of
stone were lying about in various directions, and the
water during the heavy rains had so far worked its
way among these rocks that several hollows were
scooped out so as to form caves large enough to hold
one or two human beings. These places had
evidently been recently occupied, remains of mealies
and the charred wood of a recent fire indicating the
use to which the shelter had been applied. Ascending
the kloof still farther, and keeping well under
cover of the bush, these scouts walked along what
at first seemed an old war-path, and this being
examined it was evident that it had been worn by
human beings, and not long since. On following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
this path, it led to a small piece of table-land not
much larger than an ordinary mess-tent or marquee,
and this platform was formed by a solid piece of
rock rising, not unlike the Pieter Bot at Mauritius,
to a couple of hundred feet above where the explorers
were standing. To the eye of a soldier the place
was impregnable, and as the scouts scanned the
country round by the fitful gleams of occasional
moonlight they saw that twenty well-armed and
steady men could hold the rock against an army.
The face of the rock had been scooped out, and,
either by time or human labour, a sort of cave or
shelter afforded additional protection. Upon leaving
the rock and descending the ravine to carry the
intelligence to the column in bivouac, these patrols
were startled to see the outlines of several dark
figures moving in the neighbouring bush. Making
all possible speed, therefore, the messengers hurried
back, and at the news received every man stood to
his arms. They had not long to wait, for the enemy
soon appeared, drawn out in clear relief against the
grey of the early dawn, which was now coming on.
Bodies of Zulus on the opposite ridges, which could
not have been seen lower down, were now observed,
while a few cattle were being rapidly hurried away
in the distance. The Zulu scouts were evidently
puzzled at the white men's proceedings, the more so
as before leaving the kop one of the guides had tied
his handkerchief to an overhanging branch, thus
giving the enemy the idea that a detachment had
been left to occupy the post. This error on the
part of their antagonists served the troops materially,
as, by hurrying forward at a quick pace, they were
enabled to gain the kop, and with some considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
difficulty get their Gatling to the summit. Their
horses, of course, could not ascend, but halfway up
there was an excellent position, where grass and
water were found, and here the animals were
tethered in the usual manner&mdash;by the head and
knee. When daylight enabled them to examine the
surrounding country with field-glasses, they could
see the neighbouring kraals of the chief Dabulamanzi
and his neighbour, Ungakamatue, and it was
evident that the alarm had been given. Several
extraordinary movements attracted their attention.
Armed bodies of natives were seen to be leaving the
villages in various directions, as if going upon
messages of importance. Aware of the celerity of
movement of the Zulus, and the enormous distances
their soldiers can cover in a few hours, this activity
was not reassuring, as it was concluded that reinforcements
were being sent for, for the purpose of
intercepting the retreat to the fort of Ekowe. The
English commander, however, was not long in
choosing his plan of operations. It would never do
to sustain a siege on the rock or kop, which, however
defensible if provisioned, was sure to be taken
by starvation in the long-run. The Dabulamanzi
kraal had evidently been weakened by the absence
of men harvesting, and it did not seem more than a
mile from where the troops were. One of the guides
remembered a cattle-track which, by a circuitous
route, led back on the eastern side to Ekowe, and as
the road they had arrived by was certain to be now
ambushed, it was deemed advisable to make a dash
at the kraal, and return with what spoil they could
obtain in the new direction. Having cut some long
canes, some of the soldiers fixed them securely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
between the ledges of the rocks, and attached to
them some coloured clothes, which they hoped
would lead to the belief that they still occupied the
kop. These precautions having been taken, the
troops moved silently down through the dense
bushes on the reverse side of the cliff, and succeeded
in getting away without being observed by the
Zulus, who evidently seemed principally anxious
about their cattle. Part of the mounted force
went in front to explore the bush, while the rest
remained in rear to follow and reconnoitre. On
coming again to the valley, they moved still more
rapidly until they came to a little rise, which, on
surmounting, they found led to a deep kloof, the
mouth of which was almost closed by the proximity
of the hills, on either side rising to about 600 feet
in height. These curious-looking hills appeared to
be a series of ledges of rocks, with lines of dykes&mdash;probably
of volcanic origin&mdash;cropping up, and forming
the most natural-looking breastworks, behind
which a determined party of men might destroy any
attacking party. Having waited to collect the tail
of the column, they descended the rise, and sending
out a few men to scout on the ridge skirting the
hill on their right, the commander led the main body
under cover of this range towards the mouth of the
kloof, which the guides said was the main entrance
to the kraal. When about 200 yards from the
mouth of the gorge, the enemy commenced firing
upon the advanced files from behind a formidable-looking
dyke, and seeing that one of the horses had
been badly wounded in the quarter, an officer sent
up a dozen men to the top of the range to extend
as a covering party. These had barely been posted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in a good position, when a perfect shower of bullets
fell amongst the main body, the only casualty being,
however, one man struck by an almost spent bullet.
It being thus seen that they were out of range as
far as any material injury could be effected, the men
were directed to keep moving along the flank, while
the Buffs advanced along the valley in a parallel
line, closing to their centres as they neared the
mouth of the kloof. At the same time, the men of
the Naval Brigade (twenty-five) were detached with
their Gatling towards the foot of the left-hand hill,
to see if there was a path by which the kraal could
be taken in reverse. This left-hand hill seemed to
be the key of the position, as it looked down upon
the kraal itself. The 99th were all this time held
in reserve to prevent the troops being taken in
reverse should the enemy's reinforcements come up.
While the English were effecting these movements
the Zulus, whose forces did not seem to be augmenting,
kept up what would have been a hot cross-fire
had they been armed with Martinis, but which was
perfectly innocuous at 700 yards.</p>

<p>A bugle-call now gave notice to the skirmishers
to close in, and when this was effected the mounted
men dashed through the kloof, followed by the Buffs
and the 99th at the double. The Naval Brigade
meanwhile was seen working its way in the most
energetic manner round the left flank and ready to
effect a junction with the others at the foot of the
mound on which stood the outer defences of the
kraal. A general stampede of men, women, and
cattle now took place, the soldiers being specially
warned not to fire at the two latter, and only at the
former in return. In ten minutes the outer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
inner circles of the kraal were fired, care having been
taken to see that no living creature was hidden
within. As the Zulus generally store their mealies
(Indian corn) underground in the cattle enclosures,
there was not time to look for any supplies, but they
managed to carry off a few large packages which
were found in two huts, as well as some millet
(Kaffir corn). They also collected all the cattle they
could find, not many having been left, and getting
them together in the centre of the column, moved
away by the path mentioned by their guides. These
movements were conducted so quickly, that they
were on the homeward march within half an hour of
the time they had entered the kraal. About half a
mile from the kraal the kloof separated into two
narrow gullies, the ledges of rock between them
being inaccessible, and as it was known that these
paths made a junction some two miles on, it was
decided to use them both, to enable the troops to
march more quickly. The Buffs accordingly took
one trek, and the 99th detachment the other, both
uniting again without any casualty later on. The
English attack was undoubtedly a complete surprise,
inasmuch as the bulk of the people belonging to the
kraal were away, and could not be recalled in time
to defend their village. Had the British column
possessed a larger force of mounted men, they could
have intercepted and carried back the cattle which
they saw the attendants driving off. As it was,
however, it was not safe or prudent to risk the
chances of communications with the fort being cut
off by delaying to pursue these animals.</p>

<p>The column had made good about ten miles of
the return march when they discovered that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
retreat had been found out; straight in front of
them also were wooded krantzes and dark ravines,
where an army of Zulus might have been concealed,
but pioneers having been sent out reported that all
was safe in that direction. Upon this they used the
utmost speed to gain the friendly covert, as they
saw that if pursued there was the best chance of
eluding the vigilance of their enemies; or if unable
to do this, they would have the opportunity of
fighting them to the best advantage. As the troops
moved quickly on, they entered the forest and lost
sight of the Zulus, who seemed in force, and were
apparently retracing their steps for some mysterious
object. They were not, however, kept long in doubt
as to their proceedings, for upon sending on scouts
to an eminence where they could see without being
seen, it was found that the whole Zulu force,
apparently some 2000 strong, was upon the crest of
the hill over which they had passed. An advanced
party of skirmishers were running very rapidly,
their shields held aloft, and their assegais waving
over their heads. They had discovered the trick
played upon them, and the ruse of the coloured cloths
planted upon the kop. When, however, they could
not discover the spoor upon the direct trek by
which the English party had come, they lost a considerable
amount of time in casting about to make
out their real direction. At last, however, when
crossing a bit of open veldt, the keen-sighted Zulus
observed their cattle being carried away, at least
five miles from them. The rage of the pursuers,
and their contempt for the marching qualities of
British soldiers&mdash;compared to their own speed and
powers of endurance&mdash;no doubt made them confident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of overtaking them; but the latter had little apprehension
of the result, even if this were effected.
They knew that as soon as their foes came within
range, they could pick them off at 1000 or 1200
yards, and the little column had been specially
furnished with several crack marksmen to whom
this distance was no difficulty. They continued
their march therefore steadily, and did not abandon
the cattle, which, strange to say, gave little trouble,
and were kept at a good pace by some of the
mounted men, whose anticipation of a full beef
ration on their return, from the spoil, made them
doubly zealous in their duties. In about an hour
the Zulus had gained considerably upon them; they
were imprudent enough to move in close order. The
evening was, however, now drawing on, and in
another hour the troops should be under the guns
of the fort. A mist, which had been for some time
hanging about the streams and the kloof, prevented
the exact progress of the pursuers being seen, but
the pursued were not long without intimation of
their whereabouts. The rear-guard were attracted,
when about three miles from the fort, by what
seemed to be dark objects moving between some
rocks about half a mile on their left rear. So fitful
was the view obtained, however, that the men were
uncertain whether they were Zulus or some of the
larger species of baboon, which often come out of
their holes and caves to look at any human creature
passing by. A steady watch was, however, maintained,
and before many minutes they could plainly
see that a large body of the enemy had, by the most
tremendous pedestrian feat, succeeded in getting
almost on a level with them, in a position to assail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
them in flank. The column had not long to wait,
for as they came to a portion of the trek they could
not avoid, on account of the proximity of a deep
morass on the right, the pursuers, deeming them
within range, treated them to a volley which rattled
up to about fifty paces short of their flank. Ten of
the mounted men, all excellent shots, were now
sent out to cover the attacked flank, and, as far as
they could, to harass the enemy. The ground was
difficult and broken, but this was no impediment
to these gallant fellows, who, gaining a commanding
position 500 yards from the Zulus, and where there
was admirable cover, dismounted, and kept up such
a galling fire that the Zulus retreated, as if waiting
for their main body to come up. As the mist rolled
away, they could distinctly be seen carrying off
their dead and wounded with improvised stretchers
of branches of mimosa. A running fire was now
kept up, the English shot taking deadly effect, while
no casualty occurred to their men. For more than
half an hour this went on, until the fort was sighted,
and as the Zulu main body had not come up, the
flanking party drew quietly off.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the horizon as the returning
soldiers received their well-earned welcome from
their beleaguered comrades, who were beginning to
be somewhat anxious as to their safe return.</p>

<p>Pearson's next raid was a most brilliant affair.
It was found out from reliable sources that a body
of Zulus had charge of a convoy of cattle, intended
for the king's kraal at Ulundi. Deeming the
Ekowe garrison as of no account for more than
defensive purposes, the Zulu general had merely
detailed 400 or 450 men to form the escort, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was known to be on its march not more than seven
miles to the north-west of Ekowe, not far from the
Inyezani river. Now here Pearson had an opportunity
of achieving two objects at one stroke. He
wished to explore the land and salient features of
the country towards Inyezani, in order to see
whether a road could be made by which the dense
bush of Hintza could be avoided, while, at the same
time, he could inflict a lesson upon the Zulus, and
possibly obtain some cattle. The foray was not to
be on such a grand scale as that made on Dabulamanzi's
kraal, but it was intended to be equally
important for military purposes. Twenty men of
the Naval Brigade, all the small force of acting
engineers, forty of the Buffs, twenty of the 99th,
and the mounted scouts were placed under orders
to parade before daylight on Friday, 21st March.
No Gatling was to accompany, as the utmost
celerity of movement was required, and if the
expedition did not succeed in its first dash an
immediate retreat upon the guns was to be made.
On leaving the fort at 3.30 a.m., the road by which
the band advanced was found to be good, although
here and there commanded from the neighbouring
mountains. About two miles from Ekowe a bluff
runs out from the spur of the range of hills which
had often served as a reconnoitring point, and this
was immediately occupied by the mounted men,
who had orders to keep up signalling both with the
fort and the rest of the expedition. Continuing on
its march, the column came to the Inyezani river,
which for several miles runs between two remarkable
mountains, the bases of which are clothed with
luxuriant forest growths, while above spring sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
precipices 1000 and 1100 feet high. The formation
seemed to be sandstone and limestone, affording
excellent material for building purposes. Before
reaching these dark solitudes the river passes
through a country undulating and fertile, and the
horizon is closed by higher hills, covered in the
most part by forest. These forest-trees are of
fine growth and of the most valuable description.
The banks of the river are fringed by a quantity of
bamboo-looking reeds, which serve as wattles in the
district, and which are about the thickness of a
finger, and some ten or twelve feet high. Tracks
of hippopotami are occasionally seen, and it is known
that such are in the neighbourhood. The river here
is about 200 yards broad, while the depth averages
twenty-five feet. The expedition now noticed a few
deserted kraals on the right bank, while those on
the left were found to be in ruins, as if lately
destroyed. At eight a.m. a herd of cattle was seen
some two miles off, and rapidly skirting the base of
a friendly hill the troops managed to cut in between
these animals and a body of Zulus, who appeared
to be bivouacking in front of some neighbouring
caves, where fires were lit and cooking was going
on. The mounted men, who were observing these
movements, now descended from the bluff where
they had been watching, and coming up rapidly at
a canter, made a dash at the Zulus, to cover the
infantry retreat, which they effected with the capture
of some thirty-five fine cattle. A desultory
fire was kept up upon them from the hills during
their return, and the enemy, who seemed to be
gradually augmented, at one narrow gorge managed
to get within range, slightly wounding two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the rear-guard. By noon on the same day the
men with the captured cattle were safely discussing
their frugal dinner, consisting of an extra half-ration
in honour of the event, within the old fort,
which they were already beginning to look upon as
a friend from whom they were soon to part.</p>

<p>In spite of the rapidity of the raid, the necessary
observations were made by the officers deputed for
this duty, and a rough sketch of the ground passed
over gave all the information requisite for the construction
of the projected road. This work, which
was forthwith taken in hand, had a most satisfactory
effect upon the spirits of the garrison generally.
The working parties were occasionally driven
in, but not without inflicting loss upon the enemy,
whose attention was much taken up in guarding
and patrolling the main road by which Pearson
came.</p>

<p>Wood, it has been mentioned, fell back upon receiving
the news of Isandhlwana; but this retrograde
movement was of short duration, and from that
time till all was ready for the relief of Ekowe, his
was the only column acting on the offensive.</p>

<p>From the 25th January to the 1st February his
marches and countermarches afford little matter of
interest. On the 28th he moved on to a new camping-ground,
called Potter's Store, and there obtained
full particulars of the Maglisini or Baglusini Kraal.
This place Colonel Wood had for some time known
as one of the principal rallying-points and dep&ocirc;ts of
supplies for the Zulu armies. Large quantities of
"mealies" (Indian corn) and grain of other sorts
were known to have been accumulated at this
magazine, while cattle in large droves had been seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on their way to the dep&ocirc;t. Under these circumstances
it was necessary to proceed with caution, as,
had any ostentatious preparations been made for an
advance in the direction of the magazine, it is more
than probable Wood's object would only have been
gained at a severe cost. In this view it was determined
that a cavalry raid should be made by the
mounted troops under Piet Uys, with his Burghers,
and Colonel Buller, with his dashing corps of
Frontier Light Horse. From the camp near Potter's
Store to the Baglusini stronghold was at least thirty
miles. A plain suitable to the passage of cavalry
intervened before the Manzana river was reached,
and Colonel Buller saw no reason why the distance
should not be covered in one day. The kraals of
Umbelini and of Inyatini were also in the same
neighbourhood, therefore the utmost caution and
secrecy were necessary in making preparations for
the attack. The weather had been most unfavourable
for some days, but fortunately cleared up, and
became settled on the 1st of February. On that
morning Colonel Buller, having selected on the
previous day 106 of his best mounted men and thirty-three
of the Dutch Contingent under Piet Uys, their
commandant, paraded his men under the supervision
of Colonel Wood, and explained to them clearly the
feat they were about to attempt, not concealing
the danger which they would have to incur in
the performance of a most difficult and dangerous
duty. The scene was a most dramatic one, as the
camp lanterns lit up the faces of the bronzed and
stalwart volunteers who formed the devoted band.
Each man was exceedingly well horsed, and no precaution
had been neglected in the careful overhauling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of arms, accoutrements, and saddlery. Biscuit and,
for those who cared, a little ration of rum were
served out, and with a hearty "God-speed" from
their comrades, who half envied their chances of
adventure, the little troop of 141 gallant fellows
started long before the earliest streak of dawn. The
utmost silence was ordered and maintained, while
the ground for some miles was so favourable that
the horses' hoofs were scarcely heard as they
cantered over the light and springy veldt. Distances
on horseback are so differently estimated out
in South Africa and at home in England, that when
the ground is favourable, very long, and to European
experience almost impossible, marches are constantly
made without distress to horse or rider. In
the present instance two short off-saddles only were
indulged in; the first not far from the centre of the
flat, and the next after the Manzana river had been
safely crossed. The country now became more
broken and the pace was reduced to a walk, but before
the sun was well up the goal was in sight, and
the herds of cattle were seen calmly feeding on the
slopes. No suspicion would seem to have been
excited, and it is more than probable that the very
smallness of the attacking force, and its being all
composed of the mounted branch, contributed to
the success of the affair. The kraal was exceedingly
well built, and seen from a distance of 1200 or 1000
yards it was doubtful whether it held a large guard
or not. Cautiously yet swiftly advancing, Colonel
Buller felt his way, with a few of his best shots
thrown out as vedettes. These men soon encountered
some scattered Zulus, who did not seem at all
prepared for any hostile demonstration, but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
retiring towards the hills they were reinforced by
several other larger bodies, who had evidently been
sent out to reconnoitre. After a few shots had been
fired, a sudden and simultaneous advance was made
on two sides of the kraal, and almost without
resistance on the part of its defenders the kraal was
captured. Two hundred and fifty well-built huts
were counted by Buller's men, who, losing not a
moment, collected no less than four hundred head of
cattle, and a large quantity of grain, and then set
fire to the magazine. Six Zulus were killed in the
capture of the place, and although more than one
body of them were seen hovering about in the
vicinity, numbering severally 100 to 200 and 300
men, no opposition was offered to the rear-guard or
patrols.</p>

<p>Wood then again moved his camp to the White
Umvolosi. His position here was a remarkably
strong one, and from it he commanded the passage
of the White Umvolosi, the Pewana, while his day
and night patrols held the disputed territory south
of the Pongolo. A raid was next made in the
direction of the Insulwa Kraal. The men got upon
the road about seven a.m., and steady marching for
about three miles brought them opposite the spot
where, a few days before, a large force of Zulus
had been seen engaged at drill. A scout who had
been sent out on the right front came galloping
back with the news that the Zulu cattle
were in considerable numbers at the lower end
of the valley, while he also added that the guard
over these animals was not much larger than the
English party. Piet Uys at once concerted with a
couple of his smart non-commissioned officers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
decided, as they were exceedingly well mounted, to
ride for the kloof which formed the exit to the
valley. To execute this man&#339;uvre was the work of
ten minutes, during which they were hidden from
sight of the Zulus by a tall ledge of scarped rocks
which almost divided the valley. In the meanwhile
the remainder moved steadily on at a walk, so as
not to alarm their prey. In rather more than half
an hour they had so far gained upon the cattle that
they could make a tolerable guess as to their probable
number, which was estimated at a couple of
hundreds. The main body had now arrived at a
place which Piet Uys and his Dutchmen seemed
intimately acquainted with, and the Zulu cattle and
guard could be seen on a ridge running parallel to
the one they themselves were upon. Below was a
deep kloof leading to the river. Some of Buller's
Horse were now sent round to the opposite side, to
drive the enemy down the kloof to the main party,
while they continued to march down the ridge to
meet these men as they came on. But they had not
advanced very far when, as was expected, a much
larger force appeared on the neighbouring heights,
but the cliff was so precipitous they could not join
their comrades. The seven-pounder was now
brought into action, and sent a couple of shells
right in amongst them, one of the rounds being a
capital shot. Advancing still, the English leader
saw that the enemy lately on the heights had
managed, by making a d&eacute;tour, to get to the cover
of a dense mimosa bush on his left. This move was
answered by several rounds of canister, which it
was afterwards found were not without effect. The
foes were thus driven out into the open, and at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
moment it seemed as though they were going to
fight; the Boers, however, who had been detached
to the neck of the valley now served their comrades
by an excellent ruse. They had taken with them
one of the bugle boys of the 13th, mounted on a
wiry Kaffir pony, and the main party now heard
coming across the valley the echoes of his bugle
sounding the advance. The Zulus could not make
out the meaning of this sound, and evidently
imagined that the English commander had posted
at least the wing of a regiment to intercept them.
The consequence was, that the moment the main
body cantered forward with a bold front, the cattle
were abandoned; and they were left masters of the
field, taking 170 head and some few wounded
prisoners. Two villages were left in flames behind
the retiring troops, who, as the crackling and flashing
approached the bush where the hills met the
plain, could see individual forms of black warriors
shouting and gesticulating from out of the dust and
smoke, wild with impotent rage at the loss of their
kraal and cattle. The ridges beyond the gullies
still afforded considerable shelter, and the English
party were continually fired upon as they returned
with their spoil; but it was evident that the Zulus
had not any long-range weapons, as it could be seen
from the splashes of dust how far short their bullets
were falling. Ten of Buller's men were now sent
on to cover the passage of the guns through the
drift, and in about twenty minutes, and under the
protection of the rear-guard, it was passed over in
safety.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Wood was fortunate enough to
destroy the great military kraal of Manyanyoba.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Several reconnaissances had been made by Colonel
Wood's directions, and from the local knowledge of
one of Piet Uys's men, Colonel Buller was enabled
to carry out the instructions of his chief with a
success fully equal to the most sanguine expectations.
The stronghold in question was situated on
the Intomba river, and had always been considered
by Cetywayo and his Indunas as a place of more than
ordinary strength. At ten p.m. on the 14th the
men were got under arms, and the column was
composed of a strong detachment of Buller's Horse
and fifty of the Burgher Volunteers under Piet Uys,
whose services had on more than one occasion been
most handsomely mentioned by Colonel Wood. The
men paraded without lights, bugles, or the slightest
sound, and moved off silently into the bush, without
even the jingle of a sabre or the clank of a chain.
Their march was accompanied by one gun, the
wheels of which were, however, carefully wrapped
with cloth and bound with raw hide. This was not
only a protection against sound, but a preventive to
injury to spokes and axles from the sharp boulders
and rocks in the bed of the drift. The column left
the camp by moonlight, crossing the usual ford, and
were fortunate enough to gain the shelter of the
bush without being seen or heard in the neighbouring
villages. After a couple of hours' marching
they reached a wide plain, where there was a broad
watercourse, but sufficiently shallow to be easily
forded. Here the gun, as the early grey of the
morning came on in the sky, was brought into
position, and here the final instructions were given
to the men. As the daylight grew more marked
there could be seen in front a long unbroken range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of mountains, varying in height from 900 to 1000
feet. This range ran along the valley leading to
the smaller kraals in the distance. Half the cavalry
were now sent away by Colonel Buller to the left,
with instructions to gain the bush, and wait dismounted
until the shells were heard. They were
then to dash forward at a swinging canter and cut
off the cattle to be seen feeding on the slopes, which
man&#339;uvre would, if carried out, drive them into
the hands of Piet Uys and his men posted on the
right. Just as the sun began to appear above the
horizon the gunners managed to hit off the range to
a nicety, and the second shell crashed and burst
right into the centre of the interior circle where the
cattle were placed at night, and which is usually
surrounded by the beehive-shaped huts where the
Zulus live. It was at once perceived that this shot
had caused the wildest commotion, as it was immediately
followed by smoke and flame, figures
rushing about through the village, the bellowing of
oxen, and the shouts of men. As the horsemen
advanced at a gallop towards the kraal, the enemy,
firing a random and hasty volley, fled up the sides
of the mountain, where cavalry could not follow.
All the huts and stores along the base of the mountain
were now destroyed without much resistance,
although as soon as the Zulus got a little vantage-ground
on the cliffs, they turned, and replied to the
English fire. Four hundred head of cattle and a
quantity of sheep and goats were brought off by
Buller's men, who behaved with the most admirable
coolness and steadiness. The fight had lasted about
half an hour, when indications of reinforcements to
the Zulus were observed. Seeing that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
more was to be gained, and that he might lose the
cattle, Colonel Buller gave the order to make good
the retreat, covered by skirmishers and a rear-guard.
This movement was skilfully effected without
loss, and the column reached the camp early in
the afternoon, having been about eight or nine
hours in the saddle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to strengthen Wood's hands, the Commander-in-chief
had ordered Colonel Rowlands to
join that general. Rowlands at this time had with
him, at his entrenched camp at New Derby, only
a wing of the 80th, a couple of guns, and 200
Swazis. Raaf's Horse and Weatherly's Borderers
were, however, expected daily to reinforce him. In
the meantime, Rowlands was not allowing the grass
to grow under the feet of his men, for, on the same
day that Wood destroyed the Manyanyoba Kraal he
left his camp at Derby and marched on to the Talako
range, where he knew the enemy were in the
numerous caves hidden by dense bush. The operations
were entirely successful. Five large kraals,
some of them of great natural strength, were burnt
to the ground, 197 cattle, seventy goats, and forty-five
sheep were captured. Magalini, the chief, was
killed, with ten of his men, while defending one of
the caves. One Zulu prisoner was taken, and forty
women and a number of children came in and
claimed protection. Six of the Swazi allies, under
Fairlie, were wounded, and one horse killed.</p>

<p>On a still more recent occasion Colonel Rowlands
had shown even greater activity. On the
20th February intelligence was brought to his
camp that a small force of Zulus had been left in
charge of supplies at Makatees Kop, a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fortress close to Elozo, and intended as a dep&ocirc;t for
future operations. The place was by no means easy
of access, and apparently innumerable difficulties
were mentioned to dissuade the colonel from any
hostile attempt. On the date just named (20th)
the detachment sent forward as a sort of advanced
guard by Colonel Rowlands reached one of the
mission-stations still left on the border. There was
a laager consisting of a simple stone enclosure,
bastioned, however, and loopholed, and situated on
the bank of a running stream of bright and clearly
sparkling water. In the dead of night the sentries
were heard to challenge, and the sergeant on guard
at once called his men to arms. This alarm, however,
proved to be merely the return of some
mounted Boers who had been sent on to reconnoitre
on the previous day, and the information they
brought in was important. The kraal which they
had been seeking was about twenty miles off and
supposed to be only held by about fifty Zulus,
belonging to the regiment of Nkobamakosi, and part
of the Undi or Royal corps. A large number of
cattle were not supposed to be yet there, but some
were coming in daily, and it was considered advisable
to break this link in the enemy's communications.
In the early morning, preceded by a few horsemen
(many were coming in as volunteers to both Rowlands'
and Wood's column), and marching with only
their haversacks full of rations for two days, the
little expedition started for a duty uncertain and
believed to be full of risk. Eight European officers,
275 natives, partly Swazi allies, and some volunteer
horse, the whole under command of Captain Harvey,
staff officer, formed the reconnaissance; but, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
turns out, a smaller force would have sufficed.
From the post or laager at the mission-station the
road lay up a narrow valley, from which, after an
ascent of about 200 feet, it stretched out on to a
wide grassy plain ten miles in length. On the left
of this could be plainly seen a number of Zulus
tending sheep and cattle on the hills. Crossing
part of the Iwangovini district, and fording a drift
on the Inpongo river, the Iembe mountain could be
seen always to the right; while the Eloso, a rocky
height, loomed in front. At the bottom of a steep,
rocky, and heavily bush-grown gorge, fourteen
miles from the laager, a halt and short off-saddle
were made, and every precaution taken against
surprise. From this point to the stronghold the
pathway was most difficult, and the men had to proceed
with the greatest caution, in case of an ambush,
which was half suspected. Two columns of smoke,
one from a steep krantz on the left and another
lower down on the right, were noticed, but these
were afterwards found to be abandoned camping-grounds
of the enemy, who fancied the British force
was much stronger than it really was. On nearing
the kraal, and on turning an angle of the gully, the
column came in sight of the first village, which was
as usual fortified in the Zulu fashion. As the foremost
files dashed on, a couple of shots rang out
and some assegais were thrown, causing a couple
of casualties amongst the Swazis, who, however,
showed a bold front, and, gallantly led by the
European officers, carried the kraal by a rush.
The results of this skirmish may not appear of great
importance, but, taken in conjunction with Wood's
recent successes, they had a most useful effect upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
both the minds of the regular soldiers and those of
the colonial volunteers.</p>

<p>The junction of Rowlands' column with Wood's
was the next eventful incident in the history of the
latter force. It was found, of course, impossible
for Wood with so small a column and with so few
cavalry to keep an efficient and reliable watch over
the lengthy border he had to defend, and the result
was that a Zulu force managed to effect a raid in
the German settlements over the Pongolo. Commandant
Schermbrucker had hitherto done remarkably
well in keeping his line of defence intact, but
his want of mounted men seriously hampered him,
and enabled the Zulus to elude his vigilance. A
serious raid happened on the 11th February; but
Schermbrucker came up with the marauders as they
were retiring with their booty, recaptured some of
the cattle taken, and killed about a dozen of the
enemy. On the 13th a large Zulu force managed to
cross the Pongolo, and steal past the fort and laager
of Luneberg. This was in the dead of night, and
by daybreak they had burnt a number of huts
belonging to natives friendly to or in the employment
of the Dutch. The savages rushed in thousands
upon the kraals and single huts, setting the
roofs on fire and massacring old people, women, and
children who could not escape. They deliberately
tortured to death about a score of old men, killed in
the most brutal manner at least fifty women and an
equal number of children, while they left several
young women fearfully stabbed with assegais. All
this took place within five miles of the fort; and as
fire-arms were not employed, the attention of the
sentries was not aroused. Early in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
one of the wounded managed to effect his escape,
and brought this terrible news to the laager, and
measures were immediately taken to follow and
punish the band. Patrols were ordered out, and
the utmost diligence exerted to overtake the enemy,
who, it was known, was overladen with spoil.
Before the Tombe river was reached, the leading
patrol came up with a portion of the enemy's rear-guard,
and a very pretty fight took place. The
Zulus numbered about 450, but they were embarrassed
by the cattle they had charge of, and this did
not allow them to make a good stand. The consequence
was that the Boer patrol killed twenty of
their foes, put the remainder to flight, and won back
a number of the stolen cattle. The rest, however,
managed to escape over the Tombe, and the patrol
were wisely ordered not to pursue. These raids
were principally due to the activity of both Umbelini
and Manyanyoba, and were the immediate cause of
the expedition to attack and burn the kraals of the
chiefs on the Intombe river. It should be mentioned
that Umbelini was a Swazi refugee, and not
even a legitimate chieftain of that tribe, but was
regarded by the real headmen as a mere adventurer
and pretender. Manyanyoba's people, again, were
not Zulus, but the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> or remnants of various
tribes conquered by Chaka and Dingaan. They
wandered about in a starving condition, landless,
and without flocks or wealth of any kind, until Cetywayo,
from compassion, allowed them to settle north
of the Pongolo, and on the banks of the Tombe
river. This very land was mentioned in the ultimatum
sent by Sir Bartle Frere to the king, who
had no right whatever to cede any portion of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Wood next moved his camp to the Kambula Kop,
and there entrenched himself in a position of great
natural strength. There now occurred an event of
considerable importance. Oham, brother of Cetywayo,
had always declared himself opposed to war,
had openly stated his opinion in Zulu's councils, and
had ever since the outbreak of hostilities been
making overtures of friendship to the British.
These, however, had been but lightly treated, as
suspicions of their honesty were entertained by the
powers that were. How groundless were these
suspicions the event proved. On the 2nd inst.
Oham came into the camp of Captain M'Leod, the
political agent on the border of Swaziland, arrived
at Derby on the 4th, and came on thence to Wood
at Kambula a couple of days back, and declared his
complete submission to her Majesty's Government.
Immediately before leaving his kraal in Zululand
the chief took the precaution to try and save some
of his best cattle, and he subsequently sent a thousand
head of his finest herds into the Swazi county;
but they fell into Dutch hands, and some of the
Boers, obtaining possession of them, had the audacity
to brand them as their property before
M'Leod could arrive to claim them. Oham had
with him between 300 and 400 of his people, and
was accompanied by his eldest son, an intelligent
lad of fifteen, who soon made himself an object of
great interest in Wood's camp, and a favourite with
the soldiers. Immediately on his arrival he had an
interview with, and was received with great respect
by Colonel Wood, who was informed by him that he
would have surrendered some time back but for two
reasons. In the first place, he was under a system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of espionage by the orders of the king, with whom
he had never been on good terms since he openly,
before the Indunas, spoke against the warlike attitude
and aggressive tone of his brother; and,
secondly, when he did make his first overtures for
submission, he was told that he was not believed by
the English, and would be cast into prison, and sent
to Robbin Island as a convict.</p>

<p>Oham was a black ikehla (head-ringed man), resembling
both his father, the late Mpanda, or Panda,
and his brother Cetywayo, and although a large man,
his body and muscles were firm, not flabby like those
of so many other big Zulus. After the usual salutations
he thus opened his interview with Wood:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, chief, and great warrior, whom I respect,
because you fight against men, and do not kill
women or children, I came here to your camp from
a desire to see you, and to ask you to intercede for
me and my people, who have never wished to make
war upon you, but to live in peace and goodwill,
and hunt the wild deer together. I have left more
than two thousand of my people ready and most
anxious to come in and submit to you, surrendering
their arms and cattle, and giving their sons as
hostages, if you will guarantee their safety."</p>

<p>The chief, who had a dignified manner and an
honest expression of countenance, was then informed
that he and his people should receive every consideration,
and as much protection as was consistent
with the safe advance of the English troops into
Zululand. He then assured Wood that the Zulu
army was considerably demoralized, and that, the
people having gone back to their kraals, Cetywayo
found it no easy task to collect a really effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fighting force. With some difficulty, indeed, the
king had managed to get together a strong impi,
composed of the Udhlambedhlu, or "Ill-tempered"
Regiment, whose kraal was at Udhlambedhlweni,
about six miles east of the Usixepe, to exercise a
surveillance over Oham and his people. This corps,
however, was formed originally from a clan, or
tribe, which were Dingaan's chief and favourite
regiment, and although in a measure loyal to their
then ruler, they were somewhat indignant at the
duty imposed upon them, when they would infinitely
prefer the chances of raiding and plunder, which the
present unsettled state of the border presented.
Now, when Wood was at Utrecht the previous
autumn, a letter was sent by the Landdrost Rudolph
to the Secretary for Native Affairs, in which he mentioned
the arrival of Gwegwana, the favourite messenger
of Uhamo or Oham, with letters from that
chief to the following effect, which Oham now
repeated to Colonel Wood:&mdash;"I am sent back by
Uhamo to hear what answer his father, Somtseu
(Sir Theophilus Shepstone), has sent to his message
brought by me on the 10th October last. Uhamo is
very anxious to know what is going to take place in
the land now that Cetywayo has called the whole of
Zululand together, and Uhamo has refused liberty
to his people to assemble at 'Ondi,' and will openly
tell Cetywayo that if he (Cetywayo) makes war upon
the English, he (Uhamo) will not join him, because
Cetywayo's people, Sirayo and Umbelini, have, by
their overt acts, brought the country into its present
state of trouble and disgrace. Moreover, the building
by Cetywayo's orders of a military kraal on the
Pongolo, and the claims made by him of a portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the Transvaal beyond the Blood River, which had
been, as Uhamo repeatedly told Cetywayo, ceded
many years ago to the Transvaal people, and other
acts, had never received any countenance from
Uhamo, who now asks, Why does Cetywayo want to
quarrel with the English, who have ever been his
friends, and who, indeed, placed him on his present
throne?"</p>

<p>In his second interview with Colonel Wood, Oham
was still more explicit and demonstrative. He expressed
himself with much indignation at his brother's
countenancing such a despicable character as
Umbelini, who, neither a pure Zulu nor a Swazi,
had all the vices and none of the good qualities of
either; and he added that the degradation which his
brother had brought upon the race of Chaka by such
an unworthy alliance has caused him to lose much
of his former popularity. Oham also added that, in
case of the continuance of the war, rather than be
compelled to fight against his old friends the English
he would at all hazards bring his people bodily over
to that Government, and under these circumstances
claim their protection. "Uhamo loves peace as his
father Panda did," said the chief in conclusion, and
his open and honest-looking eyes seemed to corroborate
this expression.</p>

<p>We now come to another sad event, which
though less in magnitude, is in many points similar
to the Isandhlwana disaster. Major Tucker, the
chief officer at Luneberg, gives this account of the
affair:&mdash;Captain Moriarty, with a company of the
80th, was ordered to march from Luneberg on the
7th March, for the purpose of bringing in twenty
waggons from Derby, variously loaded, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
arrived at the Intombi Drift. Earlier in the month
Major Tucker sent down to the Drift, which was not
more than four miles off, a small escort to await the
arrival of these waggons. Believing, however, the
position a perilous one, owing to the proximity to
Umbelini's kraal, on the 5th he ordered it to return.
On the 7th, however, the waggons, which had all
but been captured on the way down, did arrive at
the Drift, and Moriarty was again sent with seventy
men of his company to act as escort and assist in
getting the convoy across the stream, which was
considerably swollen by the continued rains. The
Drift was only four miles from the stronghold of the
renegade Swazi freebooter, Umbelini, who had of
late given so much trouble, and Moriarty had orders
to neglect no precaution, and above all to laager
his waggons and keep an incessant and vigilant
look-out. It was ascertained from survivors that
the waggons were actually parked, but in a somewhat
loose and careless fashion, and that no earthworks
were thrown up around the camp. For
several days the river continued in strong flood, and
consequently no crossing could be effected. On the
11th it was reported by the native waggon-drivers
that Umbelini's people were gathering in the neighbourhood.
The camp was pitched in a most dangerous
position, with its face towards some high
ground, covered here and there with dense bush,
while its rear was resting upon the swollen river,
across which Lieutenant Harward and thirty-four
men were posted. No particular precautions appear
to have been taken, with the exception of a sentry
being posted about fifteen paces from the front of
the camp, on the Derby side. When first warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
by the drivers, Moriarty ordered the men to stand
to their arms, but only for a short time. On the
morning of the 12th, at four o'clock, a shot was
heard from the unfortunate sentry, who had barely
time to call "Guard, turn out!" when dense masses
of the savages were seen not more than two hundred
yards from the camp. Their front extended for
several miles, and they could not, by the lowest
estimate, have been less than 4000 or 5000 strong.
Lieutenant Harward, who had been on the <i>qui-vive</i>,
and who had carefully placed his thirty-five men
under cover of his solitary waggon, at once called
his detachment to arms, and made what dispositions
he could to open fire upon the enemy's flank. In
less than ten minutes, however, the whole valley
was swarming with the savages, who at once proceeded
in their usual manner to surround and overlap
the camp and waggons. In less time than it
takes to tell, the camp was in their hands, and the
majority of the soldiers were assegaied, many of
them before they could leave their tents. The fight,
or rather butchery, which ensued was soon over,
and, in spite of a well-directed and well-sustained
fire from the Luneberg bank of the river, the
enemy followed up the men, and assegaied them
as they endeavoured to swim the river. Harward,
seeing the enemy crossing the river in large numbers,
gave the order to his men to retire slowly.
Then, jumping on the back of his horse, he galloped
away at full speed to Luneberg, where he reported
what had happened. The savages continued to
cross the stream, and coming on in dense masses,
for a short time a hand-to-hand fight took place,
ending however in the little band being broken up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Eight men, and the sergeant of Harward's detachment,
by taking advantage of shelter afforded by an
old and dismantled kraal wall at some little distance
from the stream, and by their cool and determined
shooting, succeeded in saving their lives and getting
to Luneberg. Ten men only were saved from
Moriarty's party, while he, with a civilian, Surgeon
Cobbin, was slain.</p>

<p>The camp was evidently wrongly placed, and was
clearly taken by surprise. Major Tucker went out
from Luneberg in person, with a small party of
horsemen, followed by 150 of the 80th, to see what
could be recovered, and the bodies of the dead
were brought over the river and buried, while
twenty-five of the enemy's dead were discovered,
and a couple of wounded taken prisoners. From
these men it was ascertained that Umbelini himself
was in command, having with him some
men belonging to our old antagonist Manyanyoba.
Mcame, a powerful induna, had been asked to
join in the foray, but refused. When Tucker and
his handful of horsemen arrived on the banks of
the river, the enemy were seen to be retreating, but
they could not be followed until the infantry came
up. Curious to remark, the waggons were not
taken, and many of them were only half plundered
by the savages, who seemed most anxious to decamp
with what spoil they had secured.</p>

<p>For his conduct in this affair Lieutenant Harward
was subsequently tried by court-martial. The
ground of complaint was his having galloped off
on his horse&mdash;the only one present on the scene&mdash;leaving
his men engaged in a desperate engagement.
The loss of the camp, or anything of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
similar nature, was in no way charged against
him. His defence was that he had ridden off to
obtain assistance from the nearest point&mdash;that this
was his duty&mdash;and that he could not send a soldier
in his place, as none of them could ride. In the
event the Court acquitted him. But in May of the
ensuing year (1880), the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief
issued the following special general
order relative to a court-martial recently held on an
officer in South Africa:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At a general court-martial recently held, an
officer was arraigned upon the following charges,&mdash;First.
Having misbehaved before the enemy, in
shamefully abandoning a party of the regiment
under his command when attacked by the enemy,
and in riding off at speed from his men. Second.
Conduct to the prejudice of good order and military
discipline in having at the time and place mentioned
in the first charge, neglected to take proper precautions
for the safety of a party of the regiment
under his command when attacked. The Court
recorded a verdict of 'Not Guilty' on both charges.
The main facts of the case were not in dispute. The
officer rode away from his men to a station distant
four and a half miles, at a moment of extreme
danger, when to all appearance the small party
under his command were being surrounded and
overwhelmed by the enemy. The charge alleged
misbehaviour&mdash;that is, cowardice in so doing; the
defence averred that it was to procure reinforcements,
and either by their actual arrival, or by
the imminence of their arrival, to ward off destruction.
In acquitting the prisoner, they have found
that he was not guilty of cowardice. The proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the Court were submitted to the General
commanding, who recorded the following minute:&mdash;'Disapproved
and not confirmed. Lieutenant ... to
be released from arrest, and to return to his duty.'
The confirming officer has further recorded his
reasons for withholding his approval and confirmation
in the following terms:&mdash;'Had I released this
officer without making any remarks upon the verdict
in question, it would have been a tacit acknowledgment
that I concurred in what appears to me a
monstrous theory, viz., that a regimental officer
who is the only officer present with a party of
soldiers actually and seriously engaged with the
enemy can, under any pretext whatever, be justified
in deserting them, and by so doing abandoning
them to their fate. The more helpless the position
in which an officer finds his men, the more it is his
bounden duty to stay and share their fortune,
whether for good or ill. It is because the British
officer has always done so that he occupies the position
in which he is held in the estimation of the
world, that he possesses the influence he does in the
ranks of our army. The soldier has learnt to feel
that, come what may, he can, in the direst moment
of danger, look with implicit faith to his officer,
knowing that he will never desert him under any
possible circumstances. It is to this faith of the
British soldier in his officers that we owe most of
the gallant deeds recorded in our military annals;
and it is because the verdict of this court-martial
strikes at the root of this faith that I feel it necessary
to mark officially my emphatic dissent from
the theory upon which the verdict has been founded.'
In communicating to the army the result of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
court-martial, the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief
desires to signify his entire approval of the
views expressed by the confirming officer in respect
of the principles of duty which have always actuated
British officers in the field, and by which his Royal
Highness feels assured they will continue to be
guided. This general order will, by his Highness's
command, be read at the head of every regiment
in her Majesty's service.&mdash;By Command, <span class="smcap">H. Ellice</span>,
A.-G."</p>

<p>It was about this time that Oham, whose actions
had now clearly proved his sincerity, and the value
of his friendship to the British, having made an
earnest request to Colonel Wood that his wives and
family might be rescued from the power of Cetywayo,
the colonel sent off about twenty of the chief's
men to collect them. To carry out the remainder
of the project, some days after, (on the 14th), a
strong detachment of Buller's men and the Burghers
under Piet Uys, with 200 of Oham's people, left the
camp at daybreak, and guided by James Rorke and
Calverly, marched to the caves of Nhlangwine,
which were situated rather more than twelve miles
east of the source of the Unkassi, and not less than
forty-five miles from Kambula. The caves were
reached at 9.30 p.m., the last of the march of seven
miles being very difficult travelling, and taking
three hours to surmount. A few Zulus in charge
of cattle were shot, and the animals which had
belonged to Oham were taken possession of. As
has been said, it was scarcely daybreak when the
little column started. They rode along for a considerable
time in complete silence, the men being
allowed to smoke their pipes, but not to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
above a whisper. At first they followed the spoor
of some cattle, which indicated the road by which
Oham and his people had come to the camp, and
then turning more in a northerly direction, followed
the course of some small streams which
flowed from the hills upon the left. The moon
shone brightly, and enabled them to see clearly
for some distance before them. Many strange
sounds were heard, the growl of some beast of
prey or the scream of the night-birds disturbed
by the clank of the horses' hoofs, or the occasional
rattle of a chain. The rapidity with which the
column cantered over the soft and springy veldt, the
dead and ominous silence maintained by all hands,
and the steady and business-like mode in which
they pursued their course, neither turning to the
right nor the left, gave the journey a singularly
weird character. As soon as the first morning's
light began to appear the guides, who rode in front,
turned into a ravine covered with dense brushwood
and trees, and, having ascended this for about three
miles, they found it was possible to ride out of it in
three different directions, besides the one by which
they had entered, and thus a retreat could be
effected if any attack were made. Here it was
decided to make the first off-saddle and partake of
breakfast. At a signal from their leader, and without
any word of command, the horsemen dismounted,
slackened girths, and took off saddles, while the bits
were removed from the horses' mouths and the
animals allowed, Cape fashion, to take the customary
roll in the grass. This luxury to a Cape
horse seems indispensable, and without it he will
rarely enjoy his grass or corn. No sooner, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
had the steeds rolled than each was again
saddled, and, with the exception of the still slackened
girths, was ready to be mounted in half a moment.
Rifles and revolvers were carefully examined, to see
whether the night dew had done any mischief, and
then, having made a careful sweep round the horizon
with his field-glasses, the commander gave the order
for the morning meal, which consisted of a little
cold tea, some bread, and "beltong" (sun-dried
game).</p>

<p>After half an hour's rest they again started as
silently as before. The day had broken with all the
splendour of an African morning. The day before
had been rainy, and the showers had refreshed the
ground and filled the various pools with water, and
all kinds of wild animals were busy and cheerful in
the plains. A number of parrots and monkeys were
screaming and chattering with content, and the
sportsmen of the party were much exercised at
hearing the pleasant double whistle of the quail
sounding from various patches of long grass.
Figures which it was first thought were Zulus were
seen on the summits of the rocks, but Piet Uys
declared that they were merely baboons, whose early
morning custom was to come from the heights to
search for and dig up roots, which seemed to grow
here in abundance. Vultures, sweeping aloft, were
circling in the air above where there had evidently
been a skirmish, for the carcasses of some horses still
remained uneaten and poisoning the pure air. Here
and there a black-breasted and magnificent eagle
sat on some withered branch, and, seeming quite
indifferent to the soldier's presence, scanned the
ground below him as if to select the daintiest morsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
for his morning meal. Mounting to the head of the
kloof the party came to a splendid prospect and
panorama stretching out below. The plains seemed
to roll away to the north-east as far as the eye could
see, while the bright, glowing tints of the rugged
foreground were mellowed away into the middle distance,
until, quite far away, the bold outlines of the
mountains assumed, not a purple, as in Europe they
would have done, but a rich blue tint, yet standing
out in fine clear relief against the distant sky, the
dry atmosphere failing to give the subdued effect of
distance usually observed in other climates. These
mountains were the Tobomba range, which run
northward, and almost parallel to the coast-line.
Amidst small groves of what seemed in the distance
to be acacia, and near the banks of many tiny streams
that wound along the plain, were groups of game.
Herds of various kinds of bok were there, and here
and there some solitary and not gregarious animal
was to be seen, now bounding away from some imaginary
danger, and now calmly browsing on the
sweet veldt. What a place for an encampment!&mdash;wood,
water, cover, commanding heights, which,
properly occupied and entrenched, could be held
against an army; and a climate where fever could
scarcely penetrate, so pure and bracing was the air.
Away up a smaller valley on the right lay the path
that had to be followed, and, leaving the bright and
smiling landscape in front, the column once more
plunged into the gloom of the bush. Two more
outspans brought them to sunset, and now precautions
had to be redoubled, as they were nearing
most dangerous ground. The chances were more
than probable that Cetywayo, on hearing of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
brother's defection and flight, had sent a party of
his warriors to take possession of his wives and
cattle, both vendible commodities in the land. If
this were the case, it would inevitably result that a
vigilant watch would be kept to prevent their escape
to Oham. Strange to say, these anticipations were
only partly verified, for as the troops neared the
caves they could see that they were watched, but
only by scattered and weak bodies of Zulus. These
fellows had evidently discovered that the white man's
intention was hostile, and they probably thought his
object was cattle, and not to recover or rescue
Oham's wives and children, for they ran rapidly
along the heights above, taking no precaution for
concealment, and seeming only anxious to drive
away their herds. As the horsemen approached the
caves at a canter, flankers were extended on either
side to prevent surprise. The excitement of Buller's
men could hardly be restrained, while the calm and
stolid Dutchmen, who glided silently and grimly on,
offered a wide contrast to their more hot-blooded
comrades. As they came nearer and nearer the
place seemed inhabited, and it was evident that the
natives sent on a few days previously had apprised
the people of Buller's advent and friendly intentions.
Then Oham's people came crowding out of their
caves, jostling each other in their anxiety to greet
the English soldiers, grasping their assegais, and
giving vent to a succession of guttural clicks, which
it would baffle any known combination of vowels to
reproduce. They did not cheer; such was not their
custom, but they waved their spears aloft, as if they
felt them entering the enemy's body.</p>

<p>Rorke, having now been sent on with a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
escort to explore the caves, was not long in reporting
that all the women and children had been collected,
and a bivouac having been formed, with outlying
pickets in every direction, and sentries posted, that
night was passed without molestation. At nine a.m.
the following morning a compact column was formed,
consisting of the rescued allies or prisoners, the few
cattle collected in the centre, and the whole party
started for the homeward march. It could scarcely
have been hoped that the retreat would have been
unmolested, yet only at the Inklepgwene, a difficult
defile, were they fired upon by a body of Zulus,
evidently hastily collected, and numbering some
thousand men. The detachment reached the camp,
with the rescued families, at one p.m. on the 16th.</p>

<p>Wood had for some time purposed taking the initiative
against Umbelini, and from information obtained
from Oham's people came to the conclusion that
Umbelini's place on the Mhlobana Mountain, which
was not more than five and twenty miles from Kambula,
was capable of being successfully surprised.
He had heard from headquarters that Lord Chelmsford
would probably start for Pearson's relief on the
28th, so he determined to take that opportunity of
making a diversion towards Mhlobana.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 26th March, Colonel Buller and
Piet Uys were summoned to Colonel Wood's tent, and
told that information had come in to the effect that
a large quantity of fine cattle had been seen on the
Zlobani range of mountains, some ten or twelve miles
from Kambula. This Zlobani range could be seen
from the camp, and in most places was steep and
precipitous, well wooded, and full of large caves,
places of concealment, and natural fastnesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Several reconnaissances had been previously made
by Colonels Wood and Buller, who had both made
themselves well acquainted with its natural features
and its various difficulties of attack. It was well known
that scattered bands of predatory Zulus, guarding
large quantities of cattle, had been for some time concealed
in these rocky recesses, and that, in compliance
with the king's orders, these bands had been consolidated
and reinforced by regiments sent by Cetywayo
from Ulundi. Colonel Wood had, however, other information,
from some of Oham's people, that all the
regiments indicated had not yet come in, and that
want of ammunition was detaining them in their own
kraals. This, as it turned out, could not have been
quite correct. After some conversation, Colonel
Weatherly and Commandants Raaf and Schermbrucker
were also summoned to the colonel's tent,
and it was unanimously decided that it would be advisable
to take the initiative and strike a blow before the
Zulus concentrated to attack the camp, as Wood
was on all hands assured they would do. Before
any operations on the Zlobani are described, it should
be mentioned that Wood had been enabled from the
additions to his column to establish a chain of communications
between Kambula, Utrecht, and Dundee.
He had also organized a strong outpost between his
camp and the Transvaal border, and another at
Doornkop, or Thorn-hill. To this place Captain
Schermbrucker and a party of his men were sent,
but had been temporarily recalled to assist us at
Kambula.</p>

<p>After the council of war held by the colonel on
the 26th, arrangements were at once made for the
reconnaissance to the Zlobani. The force selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for this expedition consisted of the Imperial Mounted
Infantry, 150; the Frontier Light Horse, 125; Raaf's
Contingent, 50; Piet Uys's Boer Contingent, 50;
Weatherly's Horse, 80; and Schermbrucker's Horse,
40, making a total of 495; and each man was supplied
with three days' rations and 100 rounds of
ammunition.</p>

<p>All the horses intended for the expedition were
carefully inspected on the 26th, and the colonel rejected
several that did not seem in good form. They
did not, as a rule, average more than fourteen hands
two inches in height, but all were stout, short-backed,
well ribbed up animals, and up to far more weight
than their appearance would lead a novice to suppose.
All these animals were trained to remain perfectly
quiet when the men dismounted to fire, and many of
them would actually come to their rider at a whistle.
Piet Uys's men were especially well mounted, and it
was necessary that they should be, as your Dutch
Boer is, as a rule, by no means a feather-weight,
being usually over thirteen stone. They are also
very powerful men, and until forty or forty-five not
unwieldy. After that age, they generally get heavier.
Most of the old-fashioned Boers still retained the
long "roer" or smoothbore, but all the younger
generation had taken to the latest pattern rifles. A
revolver and stout cutlass also formed part of their
equipment, and a single blanket strapped in front of
the saddle carried all their kit.</p>

<p>At three a.m. on the 27th, the first little band of
gallant horsemen under Colonel Russell were quietly
paraded in the moonlight, and after being carefully
inspected were addressed in a few well-chosen words
by Colonel Wood, who had finally decided to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the party. The whole party made up
altogether 495 sabres, every one of whom was a
good swordsman and a picked marksman. The
horses, although somewhat rough in the coat, were
in good wind and excellent condition, and every one
of these animals was well trained to stand fire. They
moved off quietly from the camp, and passing along
the track, which descended towards a sandy and deep
nullah with most precipitous sides, debouched into
an open space, from which the Zlobani range could
be seen in the intervals of moonlight, now and then
obscured by the passing clouds, which seemed to
foretell a stormy day. The track in many places
crossed difficult spruits, and in parts was obliterated
by thorn-trees and bush. It was frequently commanded
by projecting spurs and bluffs, from which
an enemy could have seriously annoyed the advance.
At five o'clock the column halted, and after a careful
reconnaissance, off-saddled for half an hour, while
the men partook of a ration of cold tea and beltong.
This halt was made near a large dried-up, sandy
watercourse, in parts of which the sand was moist,
and by digging holes water was found in sufficient
quantities for the horses to wash their mouths. The
surrounding country was totally denuded of fodder,
and as far as the eye could reach the most wild and
barren prospect was to be seen. Another advance
of about five miles changed the aspect of the scene,
and brought them to a slightly wooded ravine,
amidst the rocks of which ran a clear stream, over
a grassy or pebbly bed, behind which loomed a range
of rocky hills, the summit of which seemed crowned
by immense boulders, looking in the distance like
huge slabs placed by giant hands in their present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
position. Away to the left was an undulating plain,
upon which were detached clumps of bushes and
trees. Over this plain small mountain streams
flowed in various directions, winding amongst trees,
shrubs, and ferns of different variety. Here and
there antelopes were grazing, ostriches were stalking,
and now and then vultures were seen grimly circling
round in seeming anticipation of a morning feast.
A couple of miles further on they came to a large
cultivated flat terminating to the right in a long,
dark, and winding gorge, black with bush and
skirted by huge precipices of sandstone and granite.
They turned into this, and proceeded silently but
quickly along the banks of a small rivulet, until they
came to the foot of the mountain, and, after some
little time, discovered a steep path, which seemed
cut out of the solid cliff, and wide enough only for
one horseman to pass. They were more than three-quarters
of an hour scaling this path, which was
most dangerous to horsemen unaccustomed to such
tracks, and suited more to the bush bok seen here
and there as the horsemen ascended higher and
higher.</p>

<p>On nearing the top of the krantz the view was
magnificent. Away to the extreme right was the
purple range of the Ingive Mountains, behind which
the sun was fast rising. The Ingonyama came next,
and joined the Ntabatulu and Ingoma ranges, the
latter of which overhangs the left bank of the Black
Umfolosi, all along which are the most extensive
forests and inaccessible kloofs and krantzes. The
head of the column had no sooner gained the summit
of the last ledge than the leading files noticed a large
number of cattle grazing on the plateau. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
were guarded by about 150 or 200 armed Zulus,
who, however, did not see the advancing troops.
The range upon which the English party now found
themselves extended about seven or eight miles, and
was accessible only by a few most difficult footpaths
leading from the plains below. Huge masses of
scrub and boulders, krantzes, terraces, and ledges of
rock, caves and immense fissures in the sides of the
mountain, formed a retreat for the cattle, which,
upon an alarm being sounded, were quickly driven
from the grazing-ground above. The northern face
of the mountain was a sheer precipice, perfectly
bare of all bush or shrub. They were now halted,
and ordered to bivouac. At about seven in the
evening Colonel Wood rejoined them, having with
him his usual small staff and personal escort, consisting
of Captain the Hon. Ronald Campbell, his
staff officer; Lieut. Lysons, 90th Light Infantry,
his orderly officer; Mr. Lloyd, political agent (son
of General Lloyd, of the Natal Legislative Assembly);
eight mounted men of the 90th Light Infantry, and
six stalwart natives under Umtongo, one of Pondo's
sons. Umtongo had by some means or other obtained
information that the regiments named
Naxeane, Umdomandi, Ucaridanburg, Macalsiene,
Udmine, Ekotsamaclooser, and Macalvoore, under
the Indunas Umgongo, Umsimoyao, and other noted
chiefs, had left Ulundi three days before, on the
24th, and Umtongo was consequently most anxious
that the column should at once return to the Kambula.
This advice, however, could not have been
followed without exposing Colonels Buller and
Weatherly and Piet Uys, who were in front, to be
cut off and surrounded, so that it was decided that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a junction must be made with them at whatever
risks.</p>

<p>At half-past three a.m. the commanding officer
ordered the word to be quietly passed round for the
men to stand to their horses and prepare to march.
An occasional and straggling ray of moonlight
helped them to follow the faint tracks of those who
had gone before them, and before going very
far they came upon unmistakable evidences of the
advance having been opposed. A distant shot was
now and then heard, away towards the bluff of the
mountain on the north-east side; and soon after
these indications of fighting was heard the sound of
horses, and Colonel Weatherly, with his son, and
about eighty of his troopers, met Colonel Wood,
bringing him the news that on the previous night he
had been unfortunate enough to miss his road. As
the morning was now breaking, and the warm sun
commenced to light up the scene, Colonel Wood
noticed, here and there on the path, a broken assegai,
a damaged shield, rent with a Martini-Henry rifle-bullet,
and further on the bodies of some Zulus and
the carcass of a dead horse. These signs marked
where Buller had passed and had been attacked.
Campbell and Lysons therefore ascended the rocks
above a huge cave, and, taking every precaution to
screen themselves from observation, scanned the
surrounding horizon with the field-glasses. Far
away, almost upon the summit of an apparently
inaccessible and gigantic cliff, the van of Buller's
column could be seen slowly advancing, and driving
some dark masses of cattle and Zulus before them.
These officers came down at once to report, and
Colonel Weatherly requested permission to lead his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
men on to Buller's assistance, while Colonel Wood
followed with the remainder of his horsemen. This
permission being granted, Weatherly moved on by
a terribly difficult path to the right, while the remainder
kept to what seemed to be the main track.
About half a mile farther on this party saw, a few
hundred yards to the left, about 200 Zulus, who
appeared to be armed with rifles. They were moving
rapidly across the English front, stopping occasionally
to take a shot at the leading files, who had,
on account of the difficulties of the road, been compelled
to dismount and lead their horses. The object
of this detachment was now evident, it being their
intention to get between the main column and Weatherly's
little band. It was noticed that half a
dozen gigantic warriors, each armed with rifle,
shield, and bundle of assegais, led the main body of
these Zulus. These men took it in turns to run in
front, and were evidently acting as guides, often
enabling the rest to make short cuts, and thus to
get over the ground more quickly. They paused,
however, now and then, as if to examine the spoor
of the horses, on which the previous night's rain
had fallen, and from this Colonel Wood concluded
that some of his people were in the same direction.
By means of some wild vine and creepers Lysons
and one of the escort now descended from the opposite
side of the plateau on which was the cave, and
running rapidly along the top of the next ridge,
made their way unseen to the edge of the bush.
They thus commanded the plain below, and the
serpentine pathway by which Buller had found his
way to the summit of the cliff. From this point
Buller and his men could be seen scouring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mountains beyond the intervening kloof, and about
halfway up the opposite ascent were observed a
strong party of Zulus working forward as if to cut
off the horsemen above. As Weatherly and Colonel
Wood were now separated by a deep and impassable
ravine, they could only hope that they should be
able to effect a junction with Buller by different
routes, and, if possible, in time to give effective help.
Crouching down so as not to be seen by the main
column were a few of the enemy on a narrow ledge
of rock, about a hundred yards above their heads.
Where these fellows had come from it was not easy
to imagine, but they immediately opened a hot, but
ill-directed fire, which the English troopers did not
at first return, as they were too much occupied in
guiding their horses over the dangerous places,
where a single false step would have sent them to
the valley below. Meanwhile Umtongo and two of
his men had climbed round by a higher portion of
the cliff, and, guiding some of the English marksmen,
they opened a fire upon the Zulu scouts, which
soon cleared them from the path. Another half-hour's
toilsome march brought Wood upon Weatherly's
track, and they then could see the rear of
Buller's column high above them to the right.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the marvellously
rugged and weird nature of the rocks around, and
the ghastly features of the sheer precipices gaping
on either side. Killed and wounded horses now
were seen at every turn of the road, showing how
stoutly the enemy must have held their ground, and
how difficult an operation Buller had performed.
Sending fifty men round to work on our right flank
and to endeavour to take the Zulus in the rear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Colonel Wood kept his men for a few moments
under cover of a friendly ledge of rocks to look to
their rifles, girths, and ammunition, and then ascended
rapidly to the front, passing the Border
Horse, who had by this time got off the track. The
scene was at this moment intensely exciting. The
firing was almost continuous, and the yells of the
savages were re-echoed back by the loud and heart-stirring
cheers of their gallant comrades, who had
seen Wood's column coming and gave them this
encouragement. It was not long before they came
under more direct fire, and at this juncture Colonel
Wood, who had been keeping his men cool and
steady by his own presence of mind and good-humoured
encouragement, left Colonel Russell in
charge, and jumping upon his horse, as the ground
was now practicable for riding, trotted through the
skirmishers, and, closely followed by his staff and
escort, pushed rapidly to the front. This party,
with a dozen of the Border Horse, galloped to
within a hundred paces of the summit of the cliff,
where they saw that they were in the thick of the
fire, raining upon them both from front and flank,
and proceeding from a mass of Zulus skirmishing in
the most artistic and workmanlike manner from
their caves, crevices, and enormous boulders which
formed the natural fortifications of the mountain
plateau. At this moment Weatherly, with his gallant
and noble-hearted boy, aged only fifteen, and
who insisted on fighting by his father's side, were
cheering on their men, dashing boldly into the caves,
and closing in mortal strife with the Zulus. "Take
a dozen men over to the cave to the right front, and
rattle out the fellows who are firing so well, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Weatherly," said Colonel Wood, as his horse staggered
under him from a deep assegai wound in the
chest, and a savage from behind a boulder fired at
that officer at ten paces' distance. The bullet missed
him, and Llewellen Lloyd, seeing the man loading
quickly again, at once rode to cut him down, and
was shot through the head. Wood, seeing this
officer fall, dashed spurs into his wounded horse and
galloped up to catch him, closely followed by
Ronald Campbell. Two other Zulus from the cave
now fired simultaneously at the colonel, whose horse
at this moment was again struck, and fell upon him.
The colonel was upon his feet in a moment, and
assisted Captain Campbell and his orderly to carry
Lloyd's body to a ledge more out of the way. The
shot which killed poor Llewellen Lloyd tore Colonel
Wood's sleeve underneath his arm before reaching
its mark. As Colonel Weatherly's men were engaged
with several Zulus at close quarters, some
little delay occurred in their advance upon the cave,
whence the fire was most galling; and Ronald
Campbell, calling on Lysons and some of the escort
to follow him, dashed at the opening, having first
cleared a sort of breastwork at the entrance. Poor
Campbell fell, shot through the head; and Lysons
and a brave fellow, Corporal Fowler, following
closely upon the footsteps of the brave young guardsman,
killed the two remaining Zulus within the cave,
while another, severely wounded, managed to crawl
away through a narrow crevice in the rock. Having
ascertained that the enemy were retreating before
Buller on the summit, Colonel Weatherly was sent
to make a small circuit lower down the cliff, to
endeavour to hit off the path by which the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
had so successfully ascended, and which the others
were unfortunate enough to miss. Buller, in the
meanwhile, was not only driving the Zulus' cattle
before him, but was able to assist his comrades by
his fire from his vantage-ground above. The enemy
in front and flank retired, disputing every available
spot, while Weatherly was most skilfully working
round to their left rear. His disposition of his men
was most judicious, and he rendered very material
help to Wood's portion of the force, intercepting and
driving back a strong party which were coming up
to assist the body they were engaging. These,
however, eventually took up a formidable position in
some caves in a deep kloof, from which they kept up
a constant and dropping fire. Amongst Wood's
party they had up to this time but few casualties,
though the loss of such splendid and noble-hearted
soldiers as Campbell and Lloyd was a terrible blow
to their chief, whose right hand men they were.
Colonel Wood, in spite of the galling fire still maintained
by the entrenched Zulus, assisted the party
told off to carry the bodies of the dead to a place
about half way down the first hill, where, in disregard
of the bullets which kept rattling round,
these noble young heroes were buried in a soldier's
glorious grave, the funeral honours being discharged
over them by the rifles of friend and foe.</p>

<p>Colonel Wood now made a flank movement with
a portion of the column in a north-westerly direction,
to see if a junction could be effected with that
portion of the men which had been left in the charge
of Colonel Russell. In effecting this change of position
Wood had to pass under the steepest cliffs of
the Zlobani Mountain. Umtongo, true to his Rob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Roy and predatory instincts, had utilised his opportunity
by a little cattle-lifting, and, in spite of the
rather hot time he had been experiencing, was
engaged in driving, with the aid of his people, a
herd of sheep and goats abandoned by the foe. As
Wood's party were carrying their wounded men,
and now and then halted to give them stimulants,
their progress was necessarily slow, and this delay
led to serious consequences, for the large reinforcements
they knew might arrive from Ulundi later in
the day had, without their knowledge, actually
arrived, and were marching parallel to their right
front, and concealed from sight. Umtongo was the
first to discover the proximity of this hostile array,
and, although without an interpreter, Colonel Wood
understood enough of his language, aided by signs,
to comprehend the gravity of the situation. The
colonel, having obtained a fresh horse, cantered
across some very broken ground to a high bluff just
under the Zunguin's Neck, and, guided by some of
Oham's people, managed, not without considerable
difficulty, to reach a point upon a ledge of rock
whence he could, without a glass, see the movements
and exact formation of the enemy's force. The
column was evidently the reinforcements expected
from Ulundi, and had a portion of the English
column not missed its way on the night of the 27th,
it is tolerably certain they would have effected the
object of their raid and retreated to the shelter of
the camp without much loss. Wood knew of the
despatch of this army on the 24th, but did not
calculate that it could have compassed the distance
it marched in three days. As matters stood, however,
the colonel and his staff could see from their
coign of vantage that the Zulu army from Ulundi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
were marching in a line of five contiguous columns,
with a line of skirmishers thrown out in front and
on flank, forming the usual horns and chest. From
subsequent description given by Buller, it appears
that the first part of his task was successfully
carried out; that the track up the Zlobani was
correctly hit off, the Zulu entrenched caves triumphantly
carried by storm, and a large quantity of
cattle taken and driven off. Had Wood's portion
of the attack and that commanded by Weatherly
appeared on the scene of action in time to support
Buller's splendid onslaught, all would have gone
well, but the delay caused by their missing the track
enabled the Zlobani followers of Umbelini and
Manyanyoba to hold their own ground until the
arrival of the Ulundi army. Buller did all that a
skilled general could effect to bring off his men with
small loss, but from the nature of the ground it was
in this instance almost impossible for cavalry to work
with any degree of celerity. The mountain having
been carried soon after daybreak, a long off-saddle to
feed the horses and an unavoidable delay of four
hours were made, to enable the main division to
come up. Suddenly the immense force of Zulus,
seen by Wood from the Zunguin's Neck, was
observed by Colonel Buller and Oham's scouts. An
immediate but orderly retreat was commenced, but
could not be effected without the most desperate
fighting and severe loss. The enemy had massed
themselves on three sides of the mountain, and only
one terribly steep path was left to descend. This
was thoroughly blocked by the Zulus, who, under
cover, rained bullets and assegais upon these devoted
men, and then, when the moment came for close
fighting, dashed in dense masses upon their thinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and weakened files. Halfway down this fearful
gorge the road was so narrow and so steep that it
was nearly closed up by the proximity of the tall
cliffs on either side. These hills seemed to be
formed of smooth and slippery ledges, over which
many wounded men and horses fell, coming down
upon the points of the assegais waiting below to
receive them! Caves, with natural breastworks,
like casemated batteries, were on either side of the
path, wet and slippery with blood. Colonel Wood
was of opinion that the Ulundi army did not follow
up Buller's retreat for two reasons: first, because
its wonderful three days' march had in a great
measure exhausted the men, who came in such haste
as to dispense with provisions and spare ammunition;
and secondly, on account of the powerful
demonstration the main or second division made on
their flank even at the eleventh hour. To the cool
valour and devoted courage of Colonel Buller the
safety of those who came back to camp was due.
He fought at the rear of the retiring column, assisting
the wounded, charged desperately at the dense
masses of fiery Zulus who were pressing on with the
thirst of blood, and not until he saw the last of his
band through this terrible kloof did he turn his horse
to follow his men, or to think of his own safety.</p>

<p>Seeing that nothing more could be done to help
Buller in his retreat, Colonel Wood despatched a
messenger to Colonel Russell, who by this time had
commenced the ascent of the extreme westerly point
of the range, to retrace his steps eastward, and to
cover the retreat of the native allies upon the camp.
Russell lost no time in carrying out these instructions,
but before he could arrive several natives had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
been overtaken and speared. The Kambula camp
was reached by the column about 7.30. Buller, on
learning that our gallant young friend Barton had
not returned, and was away on foot with the survivors
of the Border Horse, some ten miles off, at
once obtained permission from Colonel Wood to go
in search of the party. The evening had set in
stormy, and torrents of rain were now coming down.
Buller had been in the saddle for forty-eight hours,
was severely contused, and had escaped death by
almost a miracle; but setting a noble example, he
obtained a party of volunteers, and taking led
horses, started on his expedition. Seven men, who
would probably have never reached the camp, were
brought in by this gallant act, and these were the
sole survivors of Barton's Horse. It would seem
that in attempting to follow Wood's track in retiring
they were overtaken and cut off. They then
attempted to retreat by the north and the Hyntecha
Kloof, where the majority died fighting gallantly to
the last. Splendid, manly, honest, simple, and
taciturn Piet Uys, whose father, uncles, and cousins
fought and fell in the old wars with Dingaan! On
the evening of the 17th, after the conference in
Wood's tent, he spoke in the most feeling terms of his
children, of whom, like all Cape Dutchmen, he was
passionately fond, and Colonel Wood, with that
thoughtful kindness for which he is so well known,
at once said that, should anything happen to the
father, he would interest himself with the Government
to provide for the orphans. Piet Uys could
have easily escaped, but, like Buller, he would see
the last of his men clear before turning rein. He
was last seen with his back to the cliff, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
across the body of his favourite "mooi paard"
(grey horse), with six large Zulus lying dead in a
circle round him, his empty revolver in his left hand
and his body pierced by two assegais! Colonel
Weatherly's Horse went into action about eighty
strong, and of these brave fellows forty-five were
dead, including the gallant colonel and his brave,
intelligent, and handsome son, a lad of fifteen, who,
at an age when many an English youth is celebrated
only in the cricket-field or on the river, had seen
more of real fighting than many a veteran in the regulars.
Nothing could be more sad than Weatherly's
death. At the fatal hour when all save honour
seemed lost, he placed his beloved boy upon his
best horse, and kissing him on the forehead, commended
him to another Father's care above, and
implored him to overtake the nearest column of the
English horse, which seemed at that time to be
cutting its way out. The boy clung to his father,
and begged to be allowed to stay by his side, and
share his life or death. The contrast was characteristic.
The man, a bearded, bronzed, and hardy
<i>sabreur</i>, with a father's tears upon his cheek, while
the blue-eyed and fair-haired lad, with much of the
beauty of a girl in his appearance, was calmly and
with a smile of fond delight loading his father's
favourite carbine. When the two noble hearts were
last seen, the father, wounded to death with cruel
assegais, was clasping his boy's hand with his left,
while the right cut down the brawny savages who
came to despoil him of his charge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though in all these operations of which mention
has been lately made Lord Chelmsford never once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
appears, it must not therefore be supposed that he
had rested from his labours. On the contrary they
were more incessant and arduous than ever. When
the news of Isandhlwana first reached the colonies,
it caused the utmost excitement and wildest apprehensions.
Nothing less, it was averred, was about
to happen than an immediate and overwhelming
invasion of Natal by the Zulus. The black men
were on the point of sweeping the whites into the
sea. Lord Chelmsford's first duty, after an urgent
application to the home authorities for reinforcements,
was to render these alarms groundless. To
organize of a sudden the defence of so extended
a frontier was no easy task. How thoroughly and
conscientiously it was performed the result testifies.</p>

<p>Another duty scarcely less urgent was the rescue
of Colonel Pearson. And in this project he received
aid, as valuable as unexpected, from the Governor
of St. Helena. No sooner did that official hear of
Lord Chelmsford's urgent need, than he at once
assumed the responsibility of sending on the garrison
of his island&mdash;in all 160 soldiers&mdash;to the
rescue. Captain Bradshaw, of H.M.S. "Shah,"
chanced to be lying in the harbour, homeward
bound, after a period of foreign service, but he
hesitated not one whit more than the Governor.
He embarked the garrison, and on February 19th
had anchored at Durban. There a naval brigade of
400 men was furnished from his ship; and thus it
came about that long before reinforcements from
England could arrive, and on the day that Zlobani
was fought, Lord Chelmsford was already well on
the way to deliver Pearson from his captivity.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Before</span> Lord Chelmsford set out on his march,
Colonel Pearson had sent messengers to warn him
that not less than 35,000 Zulus were lying in
ambush between the Tugela and Ekowe, in order to
assail him as he advanced to the relief of that post.
Orders were therefore sent to Colonel Wood to
make an attack on the Zulu flank, and so to create
a diversion in favour of the relieving column.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Wood advanced from his entrenched
position at Kambula Kop to the Zlobani mountain,
where Umbelini's chief stronghold and kraal was
situated. This Wood assailed, and though after a
sharp engagement, which has been previously
described, his forces received a decided check, yet
he may be said to have achieved a success, inasmuch
as he undoubtedly drew away a large part of the
force that was intended to operate against Lord
Chelmsford. Another result of this battle was that
it gave the enemy sufficient encouragement to induce
them to attack the English troops on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
day in their position at Kambula, thus enabling Wood
to obtain a solid and decisive victory.</p>

<p>From various incidents that came under his observation
Colonel Wood formed an opinion, subsequently
verified by the event, that an attack upon
Kambula would not be long in following the check
at Zlobani; a vigilant look-out was therefore maintained
during the whole of the night of the 28th.
The rain came down heavily during the early part of
the night, and shortly before dawn Captain Raaf
was sent out with twenty-five men to reconnoitre,
and, if possible, pick up any wounded or straggling.
Zulus, who would give any information as to the
movements of the strong impi known to be in the
immediate neighbourhood. About ten a.m. Raaf
sent in one of Oham's people&mdash;a most intelligent
and witty fellow&mdash;who gave a graphic account
how he was captured when left behind with the
recovered cattle taken from Umbelini. Having
taken off his distinctive head-badge, although he
was recognized by a friend, the Zulus were not
aware that he was one of Oham's people, or that he
had joined the English cause. On this account,
therefore, he was allowed to accompany the Zulu
impi as far as Umsedosi. While with the enemy he
obtained a tolerably correct notion of their strength,
and was intelligent enough to remember the names
and titles of the various corps sent from Ulundi,
and, indeed, of those which were retained by the
king. Cetywayo, he said, had divided his entire
military available force into three formidable columns
of four regiments each. One of these, consisting of
the Naxeane, the Umdomandi, the Ucaridanburg,
and the Macalsiene, was sent without commissariat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and by forced marches from Ulundi on the 24th
March, and part of this column, but not all, was
engaged with Umbelini against Wood at Zlobani on
the 28th. This column numbered at the least
20,000 men, and was well supplied with arms of
precision. Four regiments were retained at Ulundi
as a bodyguard and garrison to the king, and the
remaining four were told off to attack Lord Chelmsford
at or near Ekowe. Very early on the morning
of the 29th, Oham's friendly Zulu, feeling anxious
about his own safety, persuaded some of the Zulu
braves to accompany him some distance from
their camp, under the pretence of obtaining them
some drink. Taking a favourable opportunity, however,
he managed to elude their vigilance and give
them the slip, when he made the best of his way to
Raaf's party, who at once sent him on to the
Kambula camp, with the information given above.
This fellow gave an admirable account of the state
of feeling in the Zulu armies, and his opinion was
that great numbers of the men were now serving
entirely against their will, as they found that,
instead of getting plenty of booty in the shape of
cattle, stores, arms, and ammunition, they were the
losers, as during their absence with the army the
English attacked their kraals, and carried off their
oxen, sheep, and goats. This man, although quite
a chief at Oham's kraal, would seem to be a sort of
headman, and to be in the habit of conversing
familiarly with those in authority; for, he added,
that it was rumoured that Dabulamanzi would, if
another reverse fell upon the Zulu arms, in all probability
follow Oham's example, and proffer submission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>On receiving the intelligence of the Zulu advance,
Colonel Wood had few preparations to make, for in
the camp at Kambula each corps, each company,
each subdivision, each section, and each man had a
place allotted, and had been taught to be in that
place at one sound of the bugle. The little fort was
in an exceptionally strong position, being laid out
upon an elevated and narrow ridge of table-land.
A complete precipice, perfectly inaccessible to a
white man, even though a born cragsman, guarded
the right flank. On the left a succession of steep
terraces had been utilised, and carefully entrenched
with lines <i>en cr&eacute;maill&egrave;re</i>, or outworks, each successive
line defilading its neighbour. In front there
was a narrow slip of land, hemmed in by ledges of
rock, and swept by two 7-pounders, while immediately
in rear, upon an eminence about 120 feet above
the fort was a small <i>lunette</i>, with open gorge, and
armed with two guns. The camp at first consisted
of one laager, but an outer defence with a hundred
waggons, and an inner one with fifty, had been subsequently
added. Deep and wide ditches flanked by
<i>caponni&egrave;res</i> protected the outer boundary, and were
traced in the form of an irregular hexagon. As
soon as Oham's Zulu had made his report, the
garrison were called to arms without the slightest
fuss, excitement, or confusion, and messengers were
at once despatched to order the return of a fatigue
party which had been sent out in the early morning
wood-cutting. These men reported on their return
that they had seen Zulus scouting about five miles
to the west, and had they not been recalled they
would have stayed to get further intelligence. As
soon as the men of the various corps were at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
posts, Colonel Wood rode round to give them a few
final words of encouragement, saying in conclusion,
that he knew they would hold the fort while a man
was left to fire a shot. The tents were then struck,
and the men lined the shelter-trenches. The horses
stood to their bridles, and the ammunition was
served out by fatigue parties told off for this duty.
Most of the waggon-drivers had been taught to use
the Martini, and a few were served out to each face
of the laager.</p>

<p>It was now nearly eleven a.m., and shortly after
that time the Zulu battalions were seen on the base
of the hill. Here they halted for a considerable
time, and apparently a council of war was held.
Their movements were evidently not so decided as
on former occasions, and it was more than an hour
before any forward measure was taken. The cattle
had been brought into camp, with the exception of
about 220 which had strayed away towards the
enemy, and it could be seen that the Zulu chief had
detached a portion of his men to secure these
animals. On this movement being noticed, Colonel
Buller was ordered out to reconnoitre, and to see if
any opening offered for a charge upon the detached
body of the enemy, but no chance presenting itself,
the cavalry retired, and took up an excellent position
on the north front of the camp. A flanking movement
was now made by a body of Zulus, numbering
about 7000 men. These regiments broke from line
into column, and ran at a tremendous pace along
a ledge situated at the commencement of the cultivated
land. As the object of this man&#339;uvre was
evidently to entice the cavalry to attack upon
broken and difficult ground, Buller and Russell very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
wisely restrained their men from attempting any
sortie. The Zulus were in range by this time, but
it was thought desirable to reserve all fire until they
were massed in closer order. It was nearly half-past
one when the action actually commenced, and it
was opened by a cloud of skirmishers, who, fed by
supports and reserves, began to scale the north front
of the English post. Here, behind the outermost
line of entrenchments, Buller and Russell dismounted
a portion of their men, and each trooper being cautioned
to select his object and fire steadily, some
excellent rifle-practice was made. No sooner did a
head or a shield appear above a rock, a boulder, or
a tuft of grass, than the "ping" of the deadly Martini-Henry
rang out, and in nine cases out of ten there
was an enemy the less to encounter. Some portion
of the band of the gallant but lost Piet Uys, had
been sent to reinforce Buller's attenuated squadron,
and these men particularly distinguished themselves
as highly-skilled marksmen. Many of these Boers
still retained their old national weapon, the long
single-barrelled <i>roer</i>, carrying an enormous bullet,
suited for the destruction of big game. There is no
doubt that, in the hands of a South African Dutchman,
this is a terrible weapon. The conical bullet,
perhaps, has a greater power of penetration, but the
larger ball of the old-fashioned fire-arm, which in
appearance is not unlike a huge duck-gun, inflicts a
wound which rarely fails to kill. These splendid
Dutchmen shot with all the skill that hatred of the
savages and a desire for vengeance for their late
leader could teach, and there could be noticed on
the countenance of each a sterner expression and a
more deadly resolve than usual. From the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fort a gun was now brought to bear upon the
advancing line, but without much effect, as an intervening
spur gave shelter to the foe. The attack
was now renewed on the north side with redoubled
vigour; the lines of skirmishers fell back, and were
replaced by a more solid line, supported by the usual
dense column in its rear. Buller saw that it became
necessary to remount his men, and this movement
of course weakened the effect of his fire. He retired,
however, slowly, halting now and then, and sending
a volley into the masses which kept pouring up the
slopes. Major Russell, at this juncture, executed a
brilliant dash at a body of Zulus who were running
in an easterly direction to gain possession of a ledge
of rock, and, catching them on a favourable piece of
ground, with about a score of his men managed to
sabre a great many without the loss of one trooper.
This, however, did not suffice to check the steady
advance, and orders were sent for Buller and Russell
to retire slowly within the laager, their retreat being
splendidly covered by Colonel Gilbert and four companies
of his fine regiment, the 13th, who were
posted on the right rear of the laager. One company
of the 13th, under Captain Cox, an officer of
former Cape experience, held the cattle laager, which
gave a splendid flanking fire along the front, and
these men waited until the Zulus were within 300
yards, and then commenced an independent file
firing at the same time that Gilbert's men delivered
a withering volley. As Cox and his men could not
see the right rear, to which point the principal Zulu
attack had now changed, a skilful counter-attack
was ordered by Colonel Wood, who directed Major
Hackett to take a couple of companies of the 90th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Light Infantry to advance over the slope, and open a
cross-fire upon the enemy. This movement was
magnificently carried out by Hackett, whose men
moved out into the open as if on parade, and with a
steady advance, such as British troops are proud of,
marched on to the rear of the cattle laager, taking
the Zulus completely by surprise. Nothing could
be better than the calm and deliberate firing of these
men. Every shot told with deadly effect, and dark
bodies and shields soon began to dot the ground.
Still, however, the living stream rolled on, and as
one warrior went down in the death-struggle, another,
with a shout of vengeance, sprang into his
place.</p>

<p>It was now a little after two o'clock, and while
this attack upon the left rear had been progressing,
another strong body of the enemy had succeeded in
gaining an eminence from which, although at a long
range, they were enabled to keep up an effective fire
and inflict considerable loss upon the British troops.
Captain Woodgate, of Ashanti fame, who had been
sent to support Major Hackett, together with his
lieutenant (Strong), here behaved with conspicuous
coolness and valour. These three officers advancing
well in front of their men and waving their swords
above their heads, showed such an example to their
men that the Zulus were driven back on that side,
the ground intervening being strewed with bodies
of Zulus. A difficult and brilliantly led flanking
attack was now effected by the Zulu general, who,
having retired a body of his best marksmen from
his right along his rear, suddenly opened a galling
fire upon the left flank of the 90th companies, who,
having accomplished their task, were now ordered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
retire. In executing this difficult movement Major
Hackett was badly hit, and had to be carried out of
fire. Lieutenant Bright, also of the 90th Light
Infantry, was here mortally wounded, and shortly
afterwards died. Bright was a clever, cheery fellow,
a capital artist, a good musician, and a most accomplished
officer. It was in running forward to pick
up Hackett that poor Bright received his death-wound.
Meanwhile, from the lunette on the height,
Nicholson's two 7-pounders did capital execution.
The Zulu main body had now come within
range, and grape and canister were poured into
their masses until the slopes over which they were
advancing became slippery with blood. Standing
on the parapet, Nicholson was, field-glass in hand,
directing the pointing of his guns, when a chance
bullet struck him in the temple, and he fell upon
the weapon he was directing. The loss was observed
from the laager, and Major Vaughan was at once
sent to replace this gallant young fellow. Colonel
Wood, not to expose unduly the horses of the
artillery, had retained under the shelter of the
laager four guns in reserve. These were under
charge of Major Tremlett, R.A., who, with his subalterns,
Lieuts. Bigge and Hughes, waited until the
Zulus were within a thousand yards, and then
making a dash to a small open space of rising
ground outside the laager, worked his battery with
immense effect. The guns did not return to the
laager, but were shifted from time to time as the
movements of the enemy warranted, and to their
splendid service much of the victory was due. The
enemy had now varied his attack a second time,
and nothing could exceed the bravery and skilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
man&#339;uvring of his regiments. While the 13th and
90th vied with each other in noble rivalry, and beat
back the hordes of the Zulus upon the two most
exposed flanks, the mounted men under Buller and
Russell were occasionally led forward at a gallop
by Colonel Wood, who, whenever he saw an opening
for a charge, swept down and drove the skirmishers
on to the main body. These brilliant charges became
more frequent as the day advanced, and their
effect upon the savages, unaccustomed to cavalry,
was beyond all expectation. At three o'clock a hot
cross-fire was opened upon a company commanded
by Captain Woodgate, who had been holding a point
which was in a measure the key of the position, as
it commanded the only practicable road to the upper
lunette, which, as has been explained, was open at
the gorge. The enemy still held the range which
they had occupied during the earlier portion of the
day, and Woodgate was ordered to retire under
cover of the fire from two of Tremlett's guns, which
had now taken a favourable position for shelling the
height. After one or two shots had been fired, a
shell was dropped into the midst of the party holding
this position, and this had a most useful effect,
for the other gun coming into action at the same
range, drove the enemy's skirmishers to ground
much farther off. For another hour and a half the
troops continued to be hotly engaged with the
enemy, who, when dislodged from one flank, swept
round in the most perfect order, and swarmed in
masses upon another side. A message now arrived
from Colonel Gilbert, to the effect that he could
spare Captain Cox and a company from his flank,
as the enemy's fire was slackening, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
gradually extending their line to the right rear.
Cox had been hit early in the action, but refused to
leave his men, and led them on gallantly till the day
was won.</p>

<p>At half-past four the Zulu general seemed to concentrate
his principal attention upon the northern
side held by the 13th, and some desperate rushes
were made almost up to the muzzles of the English
rifles. Colonel Wood rode up, and complimented
Colonel Gilbert upon the splendid firing of his
men, and he was at once greeted with a ringing
cheer, which was heard by the enemy. All sides
of the laager had been in turn attacked, and
soon after half-past four a simultaneous advance
was made on the north and north-east face. An
enfilade fire, however, was made by a couple of
Tremlett's guns, and the 7-pounder directed by
Bigge did great execution at 800 yards. Some
of the bodies afterwards examined on the north-east
face were found to be literally blown to pieces.
The Zulus at this time were working round from
the right-hand hill, and here, unfortunately, a few
large boulders gave them cover. The soldiers were
here almost on a line with the enemy, who in other
places were below and above them. They had
therefore to keep a sharp look-out that the enemy
did not break through the line and penetrate the
laager. They therefore kept pouring in a heavy
cross-fire upon them at 200 and 300 yards, while
the guns were defilading them on the right. The
enemy could not stand this treble fire, and, though
disputing the ground step by step, began reluctantly
to retire. Colonel Wood at once sent messengers
to the lunette, to open upon them as they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
underneath. At this period Lieutenants Smith and
Lysons, seeing some Zulus advancing to assegai a
wounded soldier of the 13th, who was lying under
fire in the open, rushed out, and, led by Captain
Woodgate, carried the man under shelter. In performing
this gallant action Smith was badly
wounded, and Woodgate's helmet was smashed
by a bullet. Surgeons O'Reilly, Brown, and their
staff, one and all exposed themselves freely in
attending to the wounded who could not be
moved out of fire. Soon after five o'clock it became
evident that the Zulu fire was beginning to
fail, and the English commander at once led a
company of the 13th to the right rear of the
cattle laager, where the cattle had been for some
time exposed to the fire from the hill. A little
later on Captains Cox and Persse were taken by
Colonel Wood to the edge of the krantzes on the
right front of the cattle laager, where the discomfited
and disheartened Zulus were retiring
from the direct fire. Cox extended his men along
the slopes, while Persse occupied a higher ridge,
and thus a double-banked and deadly fire was
opened upon the retiring enemy. Having driven
the Zulus over the edge of the hill, the two companies
followed them up in a splendid manner; Cox,
although suffering greatly from his wound and loss
of blood, leading on his men in the most gallant
style to the best points for continuing the fire.
Word was now sent to Buller and Russell to mount
their men and pursue; and the mule battery opened
"action deft," and played upon the devoted Zulus,
the regiment of Macalooroo, under Umlinoya, suffering
most. Buller's gallant fellows nobly avenged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
their slaughtered comrades of the previous day, and
for more than seven miles the broken Zulu army
was chased like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>It was subsequently ascertained that the attacking
Zulu force consisted of nine regiments sent from
Ulundi&mdash;making a force of 23,000&mdash;and of Umbelini's
mercenaries; together forming a total of not
less than 25,000. Tyangwayo was in chief command,
whilst Umbelini held the next rank. The latter
having retreated in the direction of the Upper
Pongolo Drift, was subsequently pursued and killed
by a patrol under the command of Captain Prior, of
the 80th Regiment. A wounded prisoner of some
importance, by name Waishlahla, who was brought
into camp on the 2nd, pointed out to Colonel Wood
the bodies of Mubalawa and Maheitjesa, sons of
Mnyame, killed on the 29th; and this man said that
he knew that Mabuna, son of Umbangasita, Makweli,
son of Umlandela, Ummensododo, son of Umfoonsa,
and Tyangwayo, his brother, were also killed on that
day, together with, according to the Zulu estimate,
above 3000 of the king's bravest and best men!
There is little reason to suppose that these figures
are exaggerated; for 1500 bodies lay about the
vicinity of the camp on the night of the 29th, though
in the morning many were gone.</p>

<p>The sad duty of burying their own dead and the
bodies of the enemies occupied the troops nearly
the whole of the week following upon the attack
upon the Kambula camp. During the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd of April above 800 Zulus were buried, while
others were subsequently found in the caves and
krantzes near. There were also 326 fire-arms picked
up, amongst which were recognized one Snider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
belonging to the Artillery, and 16 Martini-Henrys
belonging to the 24th and 80th Regiments. Lieut.
Bright, 90th Light Infantry, Lieut. Nicholson, R.A.,
Mr. Ferreira, interpreter, seven privates 13th Light
Infantry, ten privates 90th Light Infantry, and one
colour-sergeant, two Frontier Light Horse, and one
of Buller's Horse were interred on the day following
the attack, the service being read in the most
impressive manner by General Wood. Wounded
Zulus were for some days continually brought
into the camp; and these men, as soon as they
found that their wounds were attended to, and
that the soldiers were kind to them, became most
communicative. They said that Cetywayo had sent
all his available men, with the exception of two of
his favourite regiments, retained as a bodyguard.
These prisoners also all agreed in setting down the
Zulu losses on the 28th and 29th at 3000 men.</p>

<p>When such individual and numerous acts of
bravery were exhibited, it seems superfluous to pick
out any special cases; but it would be wrong not
to particularly mention the name of Captain Woodgate,
whose gallantry and <i>sang-froid</i> were the theme
of the whole garrison. During the whole of the
action, and while carrying orders from the camp
to the fort, he was more exposed than any other
officer, and on more than one occasion he deliberately
risked his life to save wounded men from
being assegaied. To Colonel Buller also the same
praise must be accorded for his self-devotion at
Zlobani and the heroic manner in which he exposed
himself in carrying off wounded men from the very
midst of the enemy.</p>

<p>The situation being in every way so admirably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
adapted to military requirements, it was now
resolved to make a permanent station at the Kambula
Kop; and new works were day by day added
to those already completed. Four well-constructed
magazines were built in hollow and sheltered spots,
yet close to the guns. Each magazine was lined
with wooden frames, with splinter-proof timbers to
cover the top, while sheeting planks were placed
round the sides and passages. These frames were
all perpendicular to the length of the passage&mdash;that
is to say, across its breadth and about two feet
apart. Eight feet thickness of earth was placed
over the roof of each magazine, while a stout tarpaulin
was stretched over the splinter-proofs to
guard against the wet. Gabions were sunk to act
in the place of cesspools, and receive the drainage,
while a small parapet guarded the entrance to the
passage, with a small hole through which ammunition
was handed out. Twenty men, in relays,
were detailed for this work&mdash;that is to say, for each
magazine&mdash;and although they were to a certain
extent unskilled labourers, the officers taught them
in such an excellent manner that the four magazines
were completed in twenty-four hours. The ditches
round the fort were so deep that bridges had to
be made, part of which was permanent and part
movable. Four entrances into the fort were left,
seven feet wide, so as to admit the guns and waggons
when supplies arrived. These entrances were
closed by rifle-proof doors and gates made of strong
planks, strengthened by cross-beams, and lined inside
with thin sheet iron and raw bullock hides.
These hides formed an admirable substitute for
sheet iron, as they were quite bullet-proof and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
liable to be set on fire. Two more ditch <i>caponni&egrave;res</i>
were also added, to give increased flanking
fire. The <i>terreplein</i> of each of these works was
sunk, so that the loopholes were within one foot
and a half of the level of the ditch. This method
had many advantages, and provided for the trick
adopted by the Zulus of lying down in the ditches
and counterfeiting death, until an opportunity is
afforded for rushing at the parapet. A large supply
of brushwood was usefully employed to improve the
drains under the parapets, which suffered severely
from the continued wet weather. During spare
hours the men were never idle, and from the
brigadier downwards every officer was encouraged
to employ his leisure in instructing the men in every
species of field-defence. Gabions for rev&ecirc;tements,
fascines, hurdles, sandbags, sods, pickets, <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>
palisades, and small shell <i>fougasses</i> occupied
the surplus hours not devoted to drill, recreation,
and rest, and the few engineers belonging to the
garrison declared that as pupils the volunteers at
this work were beyond compare.</p>

<p>As in the last action it was found that the enemy
were enabled to considerably annoy the troops by
occupying some neighbouring eminences, the interior
works were strengthened with considerable skill.
The parapets were raised, extra traverses erected,
and the <i>terreplein</i> sunk. The faces of the work
were also made more nearly perpendicular to the
enemy's possible fire. Shelter-pits for skirmishers
were dug in all directions. These trenches being
only required upon sudden emergencies were not
made large, being only two feet wide by a foot and
a half deep, and with a parapet built so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
reach a height of a foot and a half. These gave
room and partial shelter to a couple of men, and to
each spot the best marksmen were told off. Horse
trenches were also constructed, so that these animals
could be sheltered from musketry fire. These were
twenty-four yards in rear of the line of the infantry
trench, and were five feet long, three feet wide at
top, and two feet wide at bottom, with ramps, with
a slope of one-half at each end. The parapets of
these trenches were three feet high, with a thickness
of two feet at the top. Half a dozen men
could make such a trench in half an hour. These
shelter-trenches were not so neatly dressed as the
models to be seen at Chatham or Portsmouth, but
they were pre-eminently workmanlike. They followed
the contour of the rather broken ground, and
were so made that cavalry could easily advance
over them. At the intervals for this advance each
trench overlapped its neighbour.</p>

<p>In contemplation of the removal of the waggons
as soon as the advance should be made, roughly-built
block-houses, made of contiguous logs placed
vertically and quite bullet-proof, were constructed
to substitute the shelter afforded by the former.
The logs were twelve feet long, and three feet of
this were buried in the ground, the buried ends
being spiked into transverse beams; roughly-hewn
beams formed the roofs, and over these was placed
brushwood covered with four feet of earth. Green
timber, of which there was an undiminished supply,
was used, and, when necessary, this was covered
with raw hides to prevent danger from fire. Now,
as the enemy had no artillery, and was not likely to
understand its employment, even if provided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the guns captured at Isandhlwana, no defence
could be more suitable. An ordinary work could,
it was found, be often defiladed from a neighbouring
height, while a well-made blockhouse, with
carefully prepared roof, was, in every case, impregnable
to rifle-fire. The plan for the roofs was as
follows:&mdash;The young trees or branches were placed
with the roots and thick ends inwards, while the
smaller ends, sharpened and shaved down thin,
were allowed to project over the walls of the building
till they reached to within three feet of the
ground. These boughs, if thin and with smaller
branches between them, would not allow the means
for climbing on the roof, should the Zulus attempt
it, as they would not bear the weight of a crowd of
men. In positions where the blockhouse could
not be commanded by any neighbouring height, the
roof was made flat and surrounded with a parapet
of earth, so as to afford a second tier of fire.</p>

<p>Whilst these works were in progression, and
some few days after the battles of Zlobani and
Kambula, some officers sitting upon a coign of
vantage at an elevated part of the fort, suddenly
descried three dark figures with shields and assegais
coming at a rapid trot towards their southern front,
along the hunting-road which leads from the Blood
river and the Buffalo. At first they seemed steadily
progressing, as if wishing to make a quick journey,
but under no apprehension of pursuit. As they
moved quickly on they were lost sight of in the
bush, and as the surrounding country was made up
of wooded krantzes and dark ravines, in which an
army might lie concealed, it was not likely that they
would be seen again for some time. Away, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a little to the right of where these men had
passed, was quickly seen a larger party, consisting
of about a score of savages, evidently in pursuit
of the first-named runners. Their shields were
flourished aloft, and their assegais waved in triumph
as they followed the spoor of the first party, who
had evidently taken to the bush as the most effectual
way of escaping the keen eyes of their pursuers.
Finding no traceable spoor which they could with
certainty follow, they became suspicious, and commenced
retracing their steps; and while this was
being accomplished the three runners were seen to
emerge cautiously towards the crest of the left
krantz, now holding a good start of the pursuing
party. While they came steadily on in the direction
of the camp, however, a keen-sighted scout, who
had taken the precaution to climb a huge rock
which jutted out above the gorge, saw the quarry,
and announced his success by discharging his rifle,
and waving the assegai in the direction of the fugitives,
whom it was now believed were messengers
bringing despatches.</p>

<p>The Zulu, it should be borne in mind, is a born
athlete; usually until forty or fifty, and rich, he is
a spare man, with scarcely an ounce of superfluous
flesh about him, and kept in continual training by
constant exertion and no excess of food. He can,
as a rule, at a moment's notice take a letter or
small packet and run his eight or ten miles, or even
walk his seventy or eighty, without breaking down.
The ground over which the pursued were running
was grassy veldt, while that upon which were the
pursuers was sprinkled with low thorn-bushes, mixed
with rocks and gravel. The pursuing party, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
were evidently the fresher of the two, while
the messengers looked like men who were at the
tail of a long journey. The foremost party came
struggling on until they reached some clumps of
thorn-trees, which, affording cover, were taken
advantage of to recover breath and observe the
enemy's proceedings. The chase was now getting
most exciting. Both the chased and the chasers
were plainly visible to those in the camp, while the
former only could observe their enemies. Noting
here and there a footprint, which served to show
them that they were on the right track, the Zulus
in pursuit dashed down the ravine and some distance
beyond where the three had doubled. The
whole party went nearly 300 yards before the
leaders halted in consequence of finding no spoor,
and they then spread out like hounds in a fox
cover to find some signs of their quarry.</p>

<p>It was really wonderful, the rapid and dashing
manner in which these human bloodhounds strove
to hit off the trail, while, having regained their
wind, the pursued trio moved on, not in great
haste, but quietly and with a considerable amount
of care, that they might not be seen by their
enemies. For this purpose they now moved with
the utmost caution over a ridge, and entered the
wooded valley which lay at the foot of the kop,
whereon stood the fort, being there completely out
of sight of the pursuers, who were still puzzling
over the spoor. The messengers&mdash;aware that they
were encountering a double risk, as they knew that
the wood into which they had gone would probably
contain Zulu scouts sent to watch the fort, and
who might have seen and laid in ambuscade for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
them&mdash;therefore trotted quickly across till they
came to a somewhat open plain, with a line of
willow-like trees, evidently denoting the banks of a
stream. Knowing that the pursuers in rear would
be only temporarily puzzled by the loss of spoor,
they therefore decided that the least risk would be
incurred by making a final rush across the open
road. Waiting for a moment to decide for what
part of the stream they should make, they took a
rapid glance around, and then made a sudden bolt
for the plain. Scarcely 200 yards had been crossed
when a terrific yell broke out from the pursuers,
denoting that the pursued had been discovered by
the Zulus in rear, who immediately sent a couple of
scouts to the heights, the better to watch which side
of the plain the messengers would make for. These
scouts at once shouted to the party below, and,
joining them, the whole body was quickly in pursuit.
The messengers had, however, almost 500
yards' start, and had obtained their "second wind."
They knew, therefore, that, if not lamed by a chance
shot, they would probably get over the river and
under the guns of the fort before they could be
overtaken. How or where to cross the river they
seemed not to know, as in some places it is deep
and wide, and in others shallow, with marshy banks
and long weed-like grasses. Here and there, also,
the stream bubbles and boils through deep gorges
where only a baboon could ascend or descend.
Seeing the willow-looking trees, the stout runners
fortunately concluded that the water would be deep
where they grew, and they wisely chose another
part where low bushes prevailed, and where there
were indications of a rapid slope in the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
which would give them shelter in crossing. The
pursuers were about 350 yards behind when the
runners reached the bank, which they found steep
and rocky, the stream itself running rapidly over a
stony bed. Although, like most Zulus, these messengers
could swim well, they could not swim safely
encumbered with a heavy gun, a bunch of assegais,
a shield, and a heavy leathern mailbag, nor could
they calculate on reaching the opposite bank without
being shot at while so encumbered. On examining
the bed of the river, they decided that it could
be waded, and that if not, drowning was a more
preferable death than torture in the king's kraal,
which, if found with letters upon them, was sure to
be their fate. They instantly decided, therefore,
to cross.</p>

<p>Meanwhile those in the camp had not been idle,
for half a dozen of Buller's men, known marksmen,
were despatched to a point where they could command
the drift and catch the pursuing party <i>en
flagrant d&eacute;lit</i> if they attempted to follow too closely.
A few minutes' interval and a smart canter brought
eight rifles in all to a favourable spot, where, unseen
by the enemy, they could watch the proceedings of
both friend and foe, and materially assist the crossing
and escape of the former. Quietly dismounting,
and placing two men, both as vedettes and in charge
of the horses, the remainder took up position and
waited for the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of this somewhat exciting
little episode. Not long indeed had they to wait.
As the quick-scented harrier changes from scent to
view, and gives melodious tongue as the quarry is
in sight, so dashed on the pursuing white shields
right up to the banks of the stream, and looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a moment at the troubled waters, seemed to hesitate
what course to pursue, imagining perhaps that some
ambush was intended. Meanwhile the messengers
had effected the crossing in safety, though not without
difficulty. Taking up more tightly the straps
that bound the mailbags to their naked bodies, and
with their rifles in one hand and shields and assegais
in the other, they scrambled like cats down the
bank, selecting those points where most ripples
appeared upon the water, and managed thus to
wade to the opposite bank. The depth was in no
part greater than to cover them above the waist,
although the rush of the stream was so rapid as to
render a foothold difficult. As soon as they found
themselves all in the water, they linked arms in some
peculiar manner and thus opposed a successful
barrier to the current, which otherwise, and if taken
singly, would have been too much for them. Half
a dozen Zulus who had outstripped their comrades
were the first to enter the stream in pursuit, which
at the point where they took it was not so favourable,
and about fifty yards in width.</p>

<p>Though magnificent specimens of their race,
burly and brawny, of immense chest depth and
breadth of shoulder, the men in the stream could
only advance at a slow pace in consequence of the
slippery nature of the rocks and stones on which
they had to tread, and on account of the rapid
nature of the stream. So entirely were they absorbed
in the excitement of the chase that they seemed to
have no idea of encountering any risks as they
ventured into the river.</p>

<p>The main body of the pursuers meantime lined
the banks, lustily cheering on their more adventurous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
comrades. Suddenly there rang out the
simultaneous reports of half a dozen rifles, and as
the smoke cleared away two or three arms raised
above the blood-dyed waters of the torrent, which
whirled the bodies of the baffled Zulus down and
away from view, testified to the skill of the marksmen.
As the surviving savages regained the opposite
bank they gave a yell of defiance, which was
answered by a volley which rendered several others
<i>hors de combat</i>. The horsemen then mounted, and
rode down to meet the rescued runners, who turned
out to be messengers from headquarters, and the
bearers of most welcome despatches from the Commander-in-Chief
to General Wood, in which his
lordship, in the most cordial, kind, and flattering
manner, sent his congratulations and thanks to the
latter, and those under his command, for the manner
in which his camp had been defended in the last
attack. A general parade was at once ordered, and
the commander having formed up the entire force&mdash;horse,
foot, artillery, and native contingent&mdash;read
out in firm and ringing tones the welcome and
honourable terms in which his lordship had expressed
himself. By permission of the commandant three
ringing cheers for the Queen were then given, followed
by three as hearty for the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="bq1">Organization of column for relief of Ekowe&mdash;The march&mdash;Heliographic
signals&mdash;Camp at Ginghilovo&mdash;Disposition of the
troops&mdash;Zulu advance&mdash;The battle&mdash;English victory&mdash;Death
of Colonel Northey&mdash;English losses&mdash;Zulu force and loss&mdash;Relief

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">We</span> must now turn attention to Lord Chelmsford
and his plan for the relief of Ekowe. Tenedos was
the base from which he purposed starting; the
distance between this and Ekowe, even by the short
route discovered and improved by Pearson, is a
good thirty-three miles. To accomplish this distance
in wet weather and with almost insuperable
difficulties in the way of transport was no light task.
However, by the 27th of March all was ready for a
start, and the relieving column set out in the following
order. The vanguard was composed of the
Naval Brigade, formed of the seamen and marines
of her Majesty's ships "Shah" and "Tenedos"&mdash;640
men and two Gatlings; the 91st Regiment (ten
companies), 900 men; 99th Regiment (five companies),
400 men; 3rd Buffs (two companies), 180
men; Mounted Infantry, 150 men; Mounted Native
Contingent, 200 men; Native Infantry Contingent,
1600 men&mdash;making a total of 3720 infantry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
350 cavalry. This leading division was commanded
by Colonel Law, R.A. The second or rearward
division, under the command of Colonel Pemberton,
was composed of the bluejackets and sailors of the
"Boadicea," 200 men and one Gatling; 37th Regiment,
900 men; 3rd battalion 60th Rifles, 900 men; and
two troops of mounted natives&mdash;thus giving a total
of 2060 infantry and 190 cavalry&mdash;the two divisions
making a grand aggregate of 6320 men, with 9-pounders
and rocket-tubes. The convoy was made
as small and compact as was compatible with the
necessary carriage of supplies for the Ekowe garrison,
and no tents were taken, each man being allowed
only a blanket and a waterproof sheet. Still the
waggons numbered 113, and there were also fifty
Scotch carts on two wheels, and fifty-six pack-mules.
Each waggon was strongly spanned, having twenty
oxen instead of the usual eighteen. Two hundred
rounds of ball cartridge per man were issued, each
soldier carrying seventy rounds in his pouches, and
the remaining 130 being carried in reserve by the
pack-mules. These waggons and pack-animals
marched in the closest possible order, and were
capitally flanked and guarded by Nettleton's Native
Contingent on the right, and that commanded by
Barton on the left. In spite of the comparative
smallness of the convoy, Lord Chelmsford managed
to bring with him not only full supplies for the
fort, but twelve days' complete rations for his own
column. Most of the baggage was brought across
the Tugela on the 28th, and, in spite of the flooded
state of the river; no casualty occurred. The rain
did not cease till daybreak on the 29th, when the
passage was completed. It must be borne in mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that the Tugela at Fort Pearson, where the column
crossed, is more than 600 yards wide, and it is then
possible to estimate the difficulties encountered at
the outset and before the journey could be fairly
said to commence. But there were willing hands
and zealous hearts to carry out Lord Chelmsford's
minute and ever thoughtful instructions. No detail,
even of the smallest, was omitted or forgotten by
him, and with such men as Commissary-General
Strickland, Surgeon-Major Tarrant, and his dozen
assistant-surgeons, as well as Commissary Walton
and Transport Officers Lawrence and Findlay, things
were bound to go well.</p>

<p>The first plan was to force a passage through to
Ekowe with all possible despatch consistent with
the safety of the column and its convoy, and then,
having exchanged the garrison and having provisioned
the brave little fortress for a month, to
form another and corresponding post on the Inyezani
hills, leaving the latter munitioned for a similar
period.</p>

<p>But this plan was afterwards considerably modified.
On the first day's march no difficulties as to
enemy or transport were experienced, the weather
had cleared, and the road from the Tugela to
Amatikula was far better than expected. Giving
up all idea of the road by which Pearson had
originally advanced when he first marched inland,
Lord Chelmsford, following Colonel Pearson's advice,
determined to move by the coast road, which
crossed much more open country, was far more
adapted for wheeled transport, and, indeed, for the
march of all three arms, while it afforded fewer
opportunities for the Zulus to attempt surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
So satisfactory was the road on the first day's march
that the only wonder was that it had not been
previously destroyed by the Zulus. In fact, the
column had made good more than half the distance
before any serious difficulties began. It will be
seen in the map that at the villages of Inyoni and
Amatikula their respective rivers cross the old road.
Now, these rivers cross the coast road as well as the
main road, flowing from west to east, and several
halts at these two places are mentioned; it is not
intended to refer to these villages, but simply to the
encampments on the banks of the rivers of the same
name.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the column at the Inyoni and
Amatikula rivers the waggons were carefully packed
in laager, and a well-made ditch and parapet formed
around the camp. Sentries were posted at the
various angles, and outlying piquets thrown well
forward. No noise, or even loud talking was
allowed, and the bivouac, for it could scarcely be
called a camp, was each night as silent as a grave-yard.
Two miles beyond the Zulu bank of the
Tugela good camping-ground was passed, but the
troops pushed on without any difficulty to the
Inyoni river, finding the road very good, although a
little heavy for the waggons, from the rains. They
were so lightly laden, however, that the drivers
managed to get the oxen along at a fair pace, the
waggons marching four, and sometimes six abreast.
Scarcely any water was met with, but numerous
Zulu kraals were passed, so streams or wells must
have been in the neighbourhood. The country
through which the column passed was very open,
affording no cover, except between three miles south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of Inyoni and the banks of the river, where there is
a gully with thick bush, which scouts carefully
explored before the main body came up. The water
of the Inyoni was found so brackish that the horses
would scarcely drink of it. The Umsundusi and
Amatikula rivers are very sweet, the latter particularly
so.</p>

<p>Leaving the Inyoni, the next river passed is the
Umsundusi, which runs into the Amatikula, north-west
of which lies the thorn country. The road
thence to Ingesani is good, but there is a mud gully
to the south of that place almost impassable after
heavy rain. The column now marched more to
their right, where the country was still open,
although there was considerable cover in places,
and kraals were seen around. Near the Umkukusi
is a hill, which was occupied for a time, but from
which nothing could be seen in the shape of an
enemy. Keeping in a north-easterly direction they
now reached a lower portion of the Inyesani, and
then bore westerly for Ginghilovo, where on the
afternoon of the 1st they encamped. Here a
parley was held with the besieged, from Pearson's
lofty signal-tower at Ekowe, and signals were made
warning Lord Chelmsford of the impending Zulu
attack.</p>

<p>A few words of digression may here be allowed
to the system of signals which proved of such use to
both Pearson and Chelmsford at this juncture.
When Lord Chelmsford came first to Tenedos and
Fort Pearson, it became evident to him that Pearson
was so completely blockaded that runners could
rarely get through. It was at the same time most
essential to his plans that the General should know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
exactly how the colonel's resources were lasting,
and the exact time to which his garrison could hold
out. In this emergency Haynes, of the Engineers,
was sent for, and asked if he could not do something
with the heliograph, and bring the rays of the sun
into requisition for the transmission of messages.
The General was at once seen, and although by no
means sanguine, he gave every facility for the
attempt. The difficulties were by no means light. In
the first place there were no proper mirrors, and a
most diminutive chamber looking-glass had to be
employed. Then again there were no skilled or
mechanically-trained workers for the improvised
apparatus, and all appliances were of the most
primitive nature. Another and, as was feared, the
most fatal difficulty was that there was no way of
attracting the notice of the Ekowe garrison, which
from the nearest vantage-point, was fully thirty
miles as the crow flies. Nothing daunted, however,
by these obstacles Haynes persevered, and knowing
that the lives of many gallant soldiers were dependent
on success or failure, redoubled his exertions,
which after long anxiety and delay were crowned
with success. The most sanguine hopes lay in the
fact that the Naval Brigade were with Pearson, and
that some of them would undoubtedly be trained to
mirror signalling. After much delay in getting
everything ready, Haynes chose a bright sunshiny
morning and went to the top of a hill about five
miles from the fort and commenced his flashing,
but without the smallest success. The church
tower at Ekowe could be plainly seen, but there was
no response, and it was evident that the attempts
at communication were not noticed, or, if noticed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
not understood. Nothing discouraged, although a
little chaffed by his comrades, the young Engineer
continued day by day, whenever there was a gleam
of sunshine, to attend the hill and work his mirror.
At length, after a whole week had passed before
any indication from the garrison at Ekowe had been
made, another thought struck Haynes, and this was
to flash occasional whiffs of gunpowder to attract
notice. To his intense delight, after a few attempts,
this plan succeeded, and when a gleam was once
flashed from the beleaguered fort in return the rest
was all plain sailing. Another week, however,
elapsed before a perfectly intelligible answer was
received, and then it was found that Haynes's
messages had been read from the beginning, but that
they could not get the Ekowe answers at first to work.
It is hardly necessary to mention how pleased Lord
Chelmsford was, and that Haynes was sent for and
thanked in the most flattering manner for his ingenuity
and perseverance.</p>

<p>As has been said, Pearson informed Lord Chelmsford
of the imminent Zulu attack; he also added
that his last raid had been successful and that some
cattle had been captured; and that the road he had
cut under fire through the bush southwards would
shorten the advance or his sortie by at least five
miles, and that his people were under no apprehensions
of famine or assault for some days. He had
improved his defences, his parapet having a command
of six feet, flanked by a couple of well-made
<i>caponni&egrave;res</i> on the northern and southern faces, with
a loopholed building on the north-west and a
sunken stockade in the south-west angle. His four
guns&mdash;two Gatlings and two rocket-tubes, in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to his Martini-Henrys&mdash;he considered sufficient
to render his fort impregnable to everything except
hunger, and should the latter come on through
Lord Chelmsford's inability or delay in coming, he
purposed making a final and desperate sortie for
life and liberty. This message was committed to
writing, and read out to the men, who answered it
with cheers of delight and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At four a.m. on the 31st ult., in the early dawn
the troops paraded outside the laager on the Inyoni.
For the first day the march had been without impediment
or opposition; progress here and there, it
is true, was slightly impeded by portions of swampy
ground; but so eager were the men to get forward
that the waggons were pushed vigorously through
the mud by willing hands. The 57th Regiment,
which had only lately arrived from Ceylon, were a
little out of condition, and the fatigue and wet had
told upon them in a greater degree than the regiments
arrived from England. After a pleasant
march, the Amatikula river was reached, where the
camp was formed with the waggons as usual in laager,
and shelter-trenches formed at fifteen paces beyond.
The night passed without any alarm, and at six the
column marched for Ginghilovo.</p>

<p>The drift on the Amatikula was so swollen that
a long time was occupied in getting the waggons
across it, and the result was that on Monday very
few miles were made. Soon after the troops had
crossed, outlying bands of Zulus were seen by the
scouts hovering on the flanks, but no attack was
attempted. The largest body of these Zulus kept
moving in a line parallel with the English march.
Towards the afternoon of this day Barrow's Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was directed by Lord Chelmsford to make a reconnaissance
in the direction of the kraal of Makuendo,
another of Cetywayo's innumerable brothers, and
they returned with the news that they had surprised
and fired it. On the previous day Barrow had
made a reconnaissance away to the north-east, at
least seven or eight miles off, without falling in
with any Zulus, whose power of concealment is
certainly marvellous. At three o'clock on the 1st
of April it became dark overhead, and a severe
thunderstorm broke over the laager, wetting nearly
every one to the skin. The night of the 1st of April
will long be remembered by those who were with
Lord Chelmsford on that occasion. Not a sound
was heard in the camp, but outside the howls of the
wandering jackal and the pariah dog were occasionally
echoed by the hoarse scream of the foul
birds which hover near a probable battle. At
intervals were to be heard the patrols going their
rounds in the fitful gleams of the moonlight, which
were succeeded by black and rolling masses of
cloud chasing each other in the sky, still thunder-laden
and lurid. The whispered "Who goes there?"
and the almost inaudible countersign, told, however,
that the utmost vigilance was awake, and that all
felt that England's honour was at stake. At two
a.m. Lord Chelmsford, with two of his personal staff,
went quietly round. This tour of inspection
lasted till three o'clock, as here and there trifling
details had to be changed and plans to be explained
to the various officers who held the most important
points of defence and danger. In front of the
camp, but sheltered behind trenches and abattis,
were that glorious and time-honoured corps, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
60th, who have no colours on which to record their
proud deeds, but whose escutcheon is emblazoned
with some of England's hardest-won fields. The
General warmly eulogized the neat and workmanlike
trenches made by his favourite greenjackets,
and passed on next to Brackenbury, of the "Shah,"
who, with his "little bulldogs," as the bluejackets
term the Gatlings, held the right angle of the
entrenchment.</p>

<p>Next to Brackenbury and his stout fellows came
Clarke with his detachment of the 57th, and at the
second corner were two 9-pounders excellently
placed and guarded by their watchful gunners,
eager as greyhounds held back in the leash. Round
to the rear, but by no means a post of less honour,
came the gallant old 91st, whose former Cape
services have long been their pride and distinction.
Four companies of this fine corps were here, and
although the ranks were made up by drafts from
many other corps, the men had wonderfully soon
assumed the peculiarly smart bearing of their new
corps. At the next angle were two more Gatlings,
and prolonging the faces were posted two companies
of the 91st, then three companies of the
Buffs, and the 99th. As nearly as possible in the
left rear face Lieutenant Cane, of the "Shah," had
charge of the ship's rocket-battery.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford expressed himself extremely
satisfied at the manner in which all his arrangements
had been worked out, and the low murmur of
gratification, which even discipline could not repress,
showed how much his men were devoted to their
chief.</p>

<p>It was as nearly as possible a quarter past four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
when the welcome news was passed from man to
man that the Zulus were seen in skirmishing order,
supported by dense masses, away some miles off on
the right front. It was nearly six o'clock, however,
when the enemy's plan of attack appeared to be
decided, and this delay, it has since been ascertained,
arose from the fact that they had heard that the
troops were about to inspan and march in the early
morning, and the Zulu general anticipated catching
them in all the confusion of starting. At six a.m.,
then, somewhat favoured by the long grass and
weeds which want of time had not permitted the
soldiers to cut down, the Zulu array was hurled
upon the laager. The regiments which came on in
front were the Unembomanaba and Unemsilya.
These were in extended order, but much closer than
skirmishing order; in fact, somewhat akin to the
Prussian infantry first attack. These corps were
flanked by the usual horns or wings, composed of
the Nokene and Nodwen regiments, formed in
respective columns right and left. In the rear, as
the body or heart of the formation, were the Monamonosi
and a favourite corps of the king's called
Zwawani. Somapo was in chief command, while
his lieutenant was Dabulamanzi.</p>

<p>The British front enticed the Zulu force, as easy
of attack, as the green-coated rifles were lying down
in their shallow trenches, and their strength could
not well be seen by the enemy. Nothing could have
fallen out more fortunately, as the fire from those
deadly tubes was doubly fatal in consequence of
each man being enabled to have a firm rest for his
weapon. There could not be a grander sight to a
soldier's eye than to watch these magnificent specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of savage pride coming on in their mighty
strength to sweep the sturdy little riflemen from off
the earth. Their white and coloured shields, the
crests of leopard skin and feathers, and the wild
oxtails dangling from their necks, gave them a terribly
unearthly appearance. Every ten or fifteen
yards their first line would halt, and a shot would
be fired, and then, with an unearthly yell, they
would again rush on with a sort of measured dance,
while a humming and buzzing sound in time to their
movement was kept up. When the first line of
skirmishers came to within 300 yards, a terrible and
deadly sheet of flame flashed from the shelter-pits,
and a great number of the Zulu warriors reeled
howling to the earth. This only seemed to incite
the main body to renewed exertion, for they came
up hurling themselves through the skirmishers, and
not even allowing them to get out of their path, but
dashing them to the ground in their rage to close
with the main array. A perfect <i>feu d'enfer</i> was now
rained upon the denser masses of the Zulu main
body, and this was maintained for at least twenty
minutes, the savages coming on, still fed by columns
from their rear, which deployed in excellent order
as they reinforced the first line, and alternately
halted, fired, and advanced, beaten back some scores
of times, and returning as desperately as ever to the
front. About half-past six this front attack and
onward rush was checked by the gallant 60th.
Lord Chelmsford on several occasions rode along
their line, giving an occasional kind and complimentary
word when a particularly good shot was made
or an especial coolness was observed. A sudden
and wonderfully well-executed change of front was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
now made, without the smallest confusion or delay,
and the masses of Zulus in front faced to their right
and ran round in column to the face held by the
57th and 91st. Here their courage was, if possible,
more pronounced, and their welcome was as hot.
The 91st had not so many good marksmen in their
regiment as the colonel could have wished, as many
of his best shots were taken to supply Indian reliefs;
but even the youngest soldiers seemed to gain skill
and inspiration from what they had seen performed
by the 60th. The 57th ably fulfilled their share of
the duty, and the torrent of lead poured upon the
enemy from the murderous tubes of these seemed to
literally plough through the hostile ranks. Notwithstanding
this deadly hail, the Zulus came on
with what was now the mute valour of despair.
They had ceased to shout and only seemed anxious
to dash upon the British bayonets. Twice, three
times, a fourth, they literally swarmed up to the
entrenchments, and if one break in the ranks had
taken place the English loss must have been terrible.
At one moment, about a quarter before seven, it
seemed as though they would have forced their way
in, and upon several occasions wounded Zulus were
noticed taking aim from behind the cover of the
bodies of their dead comrades as they lay in pools of
blood in the open. Now that they were within easy
range from the tops of the waggons, an effective and
galling fire was opened upon the Zulus by the
native contingents, who were not allowed in the first
line. This double tier of fire was of great help, and
so far thinned the assailant ranks that the second
attack was after a time renounced as hopeless. Once
more, however, a shorter, more desperate, but, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
proved, final rush was made by Cetywayo's doomed
and devoted troops. This time it was upon the left
of the laager that they delivered their last and
supreme effort. They came up on this occasion to
within ten or fifteen feet of the muzzles of the men's
rifles, and, indeed, one or two of their chiefs seized
the hot barrels with one hand, while they stabbed at
the men with their shortened or broken assegais.
It was curious to remark the three separate lines of
Zulu corpses which marked the respective ranges at
which the death-dealing Martini-Henrys had swept
their ranks. At 300 yards a thin boundary of black
bodies and white shields might be traced; at 200
and 100 yards from our lines their walls of dead
were more thick, and even up to the trenches
wounded men had staggered to receive their <i>coup
de gr&acirc;ce</i>. In spite of all their efforts, the Zulus,
however, never succeeded in bringing matters to a
hand-to-hand struggle, though, if they had done so,
Lord Chelmsford's admirable formation would have
doubtless saved the camp, although no doubt with
more than treble loss. The last attack, and perhaps
the boldest&mdash;for it was evidently the most desperate&mdash;was
led most heroically by Dabulamanzi in person,
who, with voice and gesture, came on a dozen
yards in front of the leading files, as Ney led on his
Guard at Waterloo. As on that occasion the French
horsemen, so now these stalwart warriors could not
stand against the calm, steady, and unflurried <i>mitraille</i>
of English infantry fire, and at seven o'clock
the flower of Cetywayo's warriors were scattered
and broken on the plain they had so magnificently
fought and drenched with their blood. Lord Chelmsford
saw the moment had come; Barrow, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
already mounted his men in anticipation, scarcely
waited for the orderly to repeat the permission to
dash forth. Away charged the little band of sabres,
and the mounted infantry came at the flying groups
like a whirlwind, their sabres flashing bright in the
morning sun, but soon dyed crimson with the best
of the Zulu blood.</p>

<p>During the attack 1200 rounds were fired from
the splendidly served Gatlings, and about 40 rounds
of case and shrapnel from the 9-pounders, which
subsequently shelled the bush as the Zulus fled for
cover. Colonel Crealock, military secretary, and
Captain Molyneux, of Lord Chelmsford's staff, had
their chargers shot under them. Poor young Johnstone,
of the 99th, was killed at nearly the commencement
of the fight; and Colonel Northey was
badly hit early in the action. He at first could
not be induced to leave his men, but at last was
reluctantly compelled to do so, as he fainted from
loss of blood. At the close of the action, however,
and when he was aroused from his state of insensibility
by the ringing echoes of the British cheers
which proclaimed the flight of the enemy, he suddenly
raised himself on one hand from under the
waggon where he was lying, and joined in the shouts
of the men, thus bursting the bandaged wound and
causing violent hemorrhage to recommence. This
gallant and valued officer subsequently died, on the
afternoon of the 6th, having lingered in considerable
pain for four days. The entire English loss was
wonderfully small, being but 2 officers and 4 privates
killed, and 3 officers and 34 privates wounded! The
Zulu loss, on the contrary, cannot altogether be set
down at less than 1000; for the English troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
buried between 700 and 800 Zulu corpses; and
about 300 rifles, which they discarded in their flight,
were subsequently picked up. Zulu prisoners stated
that there were 180 companies present with Somapo
and Dabulamanzi on the 2nd, and allowing each
company to be composed of 60 warriors, the actual
fighting array must have been about 11,000. Information
was also shortly afterwards received that
another impi of about the same strength was despatched
the day after Dabulamanzi marched from
the king's kraal at Ulundi, and this latter force,
misled by erroneous information, was unable to effect
the intended junction with the force defeated. These
prisoners also maintain that neither Somapo nor
Dabulamanzi was aware of Lord Chelmsford's march
for Ekowe till the day before he was assailed.
Barrow's admirably planned and executed reconnaissances
and raids on the 30th, 31st, and 1st undoubtedly
had much to do with hoodwinking the Zulus, and it
is tolerably certain that the military promenade
made by him on the 31st towards the Ingoya led
them to believe that the whole force was likely to
operate in that direction.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 57th, 60th, and 91st
were formed into a flying column, taking with them
nothing but some light Scotch carts and three days'
rations, together with the mounted men and some
of the Naval Brigade, and started <i>en route</i> by way
of the coast road for Ekowe. The portions of the
Buffs, 99th, and a detachment of the "Shah's" men
were left behind to garrison Ginghilovo, under the
command of Major Walker. The heliograph was
set to work, and Pearson replied that he should certainly
come out to meet Lord Chelmsford and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
party. At daybreak, therefore, Barrow went on
with his horsemen to reconnoitre, and to see if any
remnant or fresh portion of the Zulu army lay
between Ekowe and its relievers. The line of country
to be traversed was known to be more difficult
than that passed, and it was thought that the Zulus
might have had sufficient tenacity of purpose to
make one more effort to stay the general's purpose.
The first part of the journey was anything but pleasant;
swamps, morasses, bogs, watercourses, nullahs,
spruits, boulders, and all the disagreeable features of
South Africa were in abundance; progress, consequently,
was very much impeded, and at one time it
was thought the troops would have to encamp on
the way, and make a two days' march of the journey.
Several small but awkward streams had to be crossed,
and the General very wisely served out an extra
ration of grog after the passage of these places.</p>

<p>After travelling about five miles, a halt for breakfast
was called, and here Barrow rode back to report
that all was clear in front, and that not a single
Zulu could be seen, although the plains and bush
had been most diligently scoured. Barrow reported
that in the direction he had been, assegais, shields,
feathers, ear and head ornaments, skins, furs, blankets,
and even guns were lying about in profusion,
evidently cast away in the hurried and headlong
flight of the Zulus to their kraals, but that no bodies,
however, had as yet been seen by the scouts.</p>

<p>The shrill notes of the bugles sounded the halt,
and soon after the "Prepare to dismount," and "Off-saddle."
Although no precaution was neglected to
guard against surprise, a certain amount of latitude
was now allowed, which on the previous three days'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
marches had not been sanctioned. Piquets, as usual,
were thrown out on the neighbouring heights, and a
chain of vedettes posted, which commanded ten miles
of country in every direction. This being effected,
the infantry formed up and piled arms, the cavalry
off-saddled, and the horses, having first been allowed
their usual roll in the dusty veldt, were turned out,
under the protection of a guard, to enjoy a short
graze, having, of course, been previously knee-haltered.
This knee-haltering process is universal
throughout all the Cape Colonies, and is effected in
the following manner: by simply taking a couple of
half-hitches round the horse's fore-leg with a
strong rein or reim attached to the neck-strap, which
brings the animal's head towards the ground, and
effectually prevents his running away. This is the
simple precaution adopted by all travellers in South
Africa. The men now were told off in sections to
draw water and collect wood to make fires for their
morning or midday coffee. The officers collected in
groups, and compared notes and exchanged anecdote
and repartee.</p>

<p>After an hour's rest, which men and horses
required after their severe four days' work, the
bugles again summoned all to the ranks, and they
started anew to complete the journey.</p>

<p>From this halting-place the road had a rather
dangerous appearance, and every precaution was
taken, lest Dabulamanzi should have received any
reinforcements, which would enable him to attack
the somewhat weak column at a disadvantage. The
road over which they were passing was in itself open
and fairly easy of transit, but not far to the left, and
running parallel to the waggon-track, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
patches of bush so dense that horsemen could not
enter, and they had to be examined with the aid of
an infantry contingent, a few of whom had fortunately
been brought in case of an emergency of this
sort. Not far from the foot of one of the ascents
to Ekowe on the left of the column lay the spot
where Pearson was attacked on the 22nd January,
and which, although called the battle of Inyazani, is
some distance from the banks of that river. Some
cavalry were taken over by Barrow to explore, but
nothing marked the locality of the action except a
large mound and a roughly carved cross where the
dead were laid. On this cross were roughly cut the
names of those who lay at rest below. Leaving at
length the bushy country, the column now came to
some steep and broken ground, and here were seen
the remains of some of the waggons which had to
be abandoned from Ely's convoy. Strange to say,
some of the contents, tins of provisions and other
stores, were still intact; but no arms nor ammunition
had been left behind. Seven miles from Ekowe
the troops came to a plain from which they were
divided by a broad and well-worn watercourse.
Here they faced the steep and scarped sides of a
mountain, and in the distance could see a long
unbroken range over which the sun was beginning
to set. At this spot the Zulus had evidently
attempted to impede the advance, as part of the
road had been cut away. Engineers, however, soon
remedied the damage, and they were enabled to push
on; although it was fortunate that they had no
waggons, as it was not without considerable effort
they managed to get the two-wheeled carts across.
As soon as this spot had been passed, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
character of the landscape changed as if by magic;
and as the wind freshened and carried away some
misty clouds, the remnants of the late rains, a
splendid prospect was seen, as the column wound
its slow trail along a steep and rugged kloof leading
into a fair and fertile valley beyond. Here, however,
was a position that might have been held for
some considerable time had the enemy chosen this
spot to oppose the march. A sheer precipitous rock
frowned on the right, and the only possible track
lay exactly under its base, where with a few resolute
savages above, huge boulders and masses of rock
could have been hurled upon the column as it passed.
On the left was a spongy swamp perfectly impassable
to wheels, and not particularly easy to troops or
human feet. Here a short way up the mountain
farther on were seen the remains of a ruined kraal,
and of some huts apparently not long vacated.
These dwellings were formed, as usual, of rudely
twined canes wattled and filled in with clay, and
they had somewhat the appearance of a cluster of
huge beehives.</p>

<p>As the leading files quitted the low ground, signals
were made by the advanced patrols that cavalry
were in sight, and the General and several of his
staff at once galloped past the column to the
front. All anxieties were briefly at an end, for,
mounted upon an exceedingly handsome charger,
and attended by a numerous cavalcade, coming
towards the column at a smart canter was the
gallant soldier who had held his inhospitable guard
at Ekowe for more than seventy days.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford at once spurred forward, and
warmly grasped Colonel Pearson by the hand, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
discipline for once gave way, and the respectful
silence of the General's escort was broken by a cheer
such as only English throats can give, waking up
every echo of the Zulu caves and valleys.</p>

<p>Colonel Pearson brought with him, according to
his promise, about 500 men, and his staff, consisting
of Colonel Walker and Captains M'Gregor and
Knight. A long conversation at once took place,
and the General informed Colonel Pearson that, anticipating
the evacuation of the fort, he had left part
of his force to entrench Ginghilovo, and make it a
permanent station. The reasons for this were manifold.
In the first place the approaches to Ekowe
were easy to the Zulus, unencumbered with baggage
or other <i>impedimenta</i>, but most difficult and trying
to a European force. Ginghilovo or its neighbourhood
answered every purpose as a link in the line
of communications, while a site could be chosen
equally as formidable in a defensive point of view.
The column did not reach Ekowe fort till nearly
eleven p.m. Here the welcome of comrades, fellow-messmates,
and men of the same ships and corps,
was a happy and fitting sequel to the <i>rencontre</i> of the
reliever and the relieved.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant surprise to the General on
arriving at Ekowe to find that matters had been
made much worse by report than they were in
reality. No gaunt and famine-stricken faces greeted
him, but, on the contrary, there was a look of plumpness
about most of the privates that savoured more
of want of exercise than want of beef. In fact, the
medical officer stated that the meat ration had never
been diminished, as it was considered just as advisable
to kill and consume the trek oxen as to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
them die for want of forage. Now a trek ox in the
best condition is not particularly tender, or even
when fed upon the best of food, but when kept short
of fodder, and without proper shelter from the sun
and rain, he cuts up anything but well for beef.
Tobacco was the article most wanted by both
soldiers and sailors, and the most agreeable gift
that could be made by the relievers to their lately
besieged comrades was this luxury in any form or
shape. The health of the garrison at first was good,
but gradually the want of vegetables and useful
medicines filled the hospitals, and made the cemetery
more full. Anxiety, doubtless, had much to do
with the sick-roll, and until communications with
St. Andrew's Mission had been established a certain
amount of uneasiness was felt as to how the war
was going. Thirty deaths occurred during the
seventy days the garrison were shut up, but several
of these, it must be remembered, were cases of
wounded men from the fighting at the Inyezani. At
Fort Ekowe the hero of the scouting parties was
undoubtedly young Rowden, of the 99th, who was
detailed by Colonel Pearson to form a mounted
infantry corps similar to Barrow's, from volunteers
from the Buffs and his own corps. It is no secret
that one of the great advantages we possess in our
service is that we are never at a loss, when we can
get horses, to find riders. Most of our youngsters
in the service would rather have a stigma on their
morals than on their knowledge of horseflesh and of
horsemanship, and herein lies the secret of our
bearing up against our first reverses in Zululand.
Every officer, serving in South Africa, whether
cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineers, medical staff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
or commissariat, gets rations or allowances for horse
or horses, according to his rank. This is one of the
secrets, combined with the sport and shooting, why
South African service is so popular. Now both the
99th and the Buffs vied with the 13th and 90th in
their equestrian proclivities, and, in default of
regular cavalry, a large body of mounted infantry
was raised, and in a great measure mounted from
the horses belonging to the officers of their respective
regiments, lent or sold to Government for the
purpose. Rowden's patrols were literally the
"eyes and ears" of the garrison, and ably fulfilled
all the onerous duties of light cavalry. In short
the great value of their services may be gathered
from the frequently and openly stated opinions of
Colonel Wood and of Colonel Pearson, that all
infantry regiments serving at the Cape should have
at least one Gatling and one mounted company.</p>

<p>The great event of the camp life in Ekowe was
the discovery of certain queer flashes of light on
the white walls of the church tower. These, after
puzzling many of the officers and soldiers, were at
length brought under the notice of an officer of the
naval brigade, whose education in the use of the
heliograph enabled him at once to explain the
apparent mystery. Three days of unpleasant suspense,
however, elapsed before the first message
could be clearly made out, and then three more
before an apparatus could be rendered workable to
reply. Fortunately an old mirror was found, and
this, with an empty wooden cartridge case, sufficed.
Within the week, therefore, conversation was opened,
and its effect on the imprisoned garrison was seen
by all to be more beneficial than all the tonics the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
hospital could afford. The next great event was,
perhaps, the construction of the road from the fort
to the lower coast trek, and the consequent excitement
of having to work with the chance of feeling
an assegai or Zulu bullet whizzing into the party.
But the long days and longer nights were not at all
devoid of recreation. Lawn tennis, bowls, ninepins,
and quoits were devised. Concerts were organized,
and dramatic recitals on a modest scale were
improvised.</p>

<p>A cavalry raid had been, it will be remembered,
made some time back upon Dabulamanzi's kraal,
which was shelled and burned by Pearson. Some
cattle and sheep were captured, and a desultory and
running fight was kept up between the discomfited
chief and the English patrols, which resulted in no
casualty to the troops, while several Zulus were
killed. This attack did not, however, extend to
Dabulamanzi's private habitation, as its approaches
were considered too far off and too difficult of
access. No sooner, however, had Lord Chelmsford
arrived at Ekowe than he determined to complete
the blow already commenced. It was decided to
effect this raid with Barrow's horsemen. The whole
affair was promptly and admirably organized, and at
eight o'clock on the morning after Lord Chelmsford's
arrival a group of officers might have been seen on
foot conversing, while their horses were led up and
down by the attendant orderlies. First of all there
was the Commander-in-chief, and with him his
military secretary, Colonel Crealock, whose recent
wound did not even place him for one day upon the
sick report. Major Barrow was there in his workmanlike
dress, a Norfolk shirt patched with leather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
high untanned boots, and a stout sabre at his side.
With him were John Dunn, Lieutenants Sugden,
Rawlins, and Courtenay, Captains Addison, M'Lean,
and Ganz.</p>

<p>The entire force consisted of 50 mounted infantry
under Barrow, 55 volunteers under Addison, and
120 volunteers under Ganz and M'Lean. At a
quarter to nine the cavalcade had been inspected by
their respective commanders, and in sections of fours
moved off, amid the smiles and congratulations of
the garrison. The road was as usual over that
sweet-smelling and springy turf which makes
walking an impossibility, and any pace but a canter
impossible to man and beast. A little more than
half an hour, or about a four-mile spurt over the
elastic veldt, brought them in sight of Dabulamanzi's
"great place." A rolling grassy plain,
leading to some easy and gentle slopes, was presented
to view, and evidently to the astonishment of
most of the party, who had been accustomed to the
rude and rocky fastnesses in which these kraals are
usually built. Beyond these smiling and inviting
hills the kraal itself could scarcely be seen, but its
locality was indicated by half a dozen Zulus running
away with some cattle at full speed. Their measures
were quickly taken, as their information forbade
them to imagine that any trap could be laid, and
they knew that the chances were ten to one against
the chief having any force near enough to make a
stand against them. Lord Chelmsford paid Major
Barrow the high compliment of allowing him to
take an independent command of the whole party,
and remained more as a spectator than as an active
official on the scene. Barrow at once detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
mounted portions of his men right and left, while
he led the way direct at a smart canter at the kraal.
The combined movement answered admirably, and
the place was surrounded as if by magic, without
any resistance or a shot being fired. Rawlins, and
a few of Barrow's men, were now ordered to dash
into the kraal, and as soon as they had assured
themselves that there were no women or children or
sick people there, to fire it in various places. They
had scarcely galloped off to carry out this order
when the silence was broken by the well-known
"ping" of a rifle, sounding from the near vicinity
of the kraal; and on looking in the direction from
which the sound came the General and his staff
could see a small group of Zulus taking deliberate
aim at them. The distance was about 1200 yards.
But the General still moved on, although the bullet
had been well aimed, for it whizzed just over the head
of one of his aides-de-camp; and John Dunn, putting
up his glass, declared that he recognized Dabulamanzi
by his head-dress and peculiar method of
walking. With the utmost nonchalance John began
to load his weapon, and remarked to the General,
"See what will happen!" One of the Zulus at this
moment was coolly making a rest for his rifle upon
a ledge of rock behind which his chief had retired,
and Dunn, taking a long and careful aim, fired, and
evidently wounded his man, who slipped back into
the arms of a comrade. As the party sent to fire
the kraal emerged from its outer enclosure, a heavy
cloud of smoke betokened that their mission was
accomplished. This white column hid the horsemen
from the natives, who finding themselves in danger
of being surrounded and captured by Sugden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his detached party, made a hasty and somewhat undignified
retreat. The General now moved round to
the right, and found that the detached party under
Nettleton were coming back with a fine young
Zulu, whom they had overtaken and captured on
the left of the kraal. They had secured him with
some buffalo-hide girths, and he readily&mdash;too readily
for belief&mdash;answered John Dunn's questions, informing
him that the cattle, women, and children had
time to escape from the kraal, as the horsemen were
discovered cantering across the open. He added
that had they advanced a little faster they would
have captured them. But this was not their object,
and they were rather glad not to have the encumbrance
of prisoners, remembering the trouble Oham's
wives and relations gave at Kambula.</p>

<p>The return to Ekowe was accomplished without
further incident. On the following day, having
destroyed as much of the fortifications at Ekowe as
time would permit, they started upon the return
journey to the camp at Ginghilovo. They overtook
Pearson in laager after having marched about six
miles; and while he and his column moved on later
in the day to his destination on the Lower Tugela,
Lord Chelmsford and his division halted and laagered
camp at about two miles north of Inyezani, and
about five from Ginghilovo. Here an unfortunate
disaster occurred. A young sentry of the 91st
fancied he saw Zulus in the bush. He at once,
without challenging, as he should have done,
fired. The picket to which he belonged at once
retired, and as Dunn's scouts were out reconnoitring,
they ran in upon the next picket to the
camp, composed also of young soldiers of the 60th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
who, mistaking them for Zulus charging upon the
laager, recklessly opened fire, by which four of their
own men were wounded and one killed, while nine
of the unfortunate scouts were badly wounded. The
officer commanding the picket did all he could to
steady his men, and did not even retire with them,
so he was quite blameless. On the 24th April they
reached the entrenchments at Ginghilovo, which
were about two miles from the former laager, and
Lord Chelmsford, having given the fullest instructions
in regard to strengthening and guarding the
camp, started on the following day for Fort Tenedos,
<i>en route</i> for Durban, to reorganize an immediate
advance.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> relief of Ekowe, and the Zulu defeats at Ginghilovo
and Kambula, mark in a most unmistakable
manner the conclusion of the first period of the
Zulu war. All fear of an invasion of Natal was
now completely dissipated, and the only task that
remained to be accomplished was to organize a force
to carry an offensive war into the heart of Cetywayo's
kingdom. Kambula and Ginghilovo had neutralized
the disastrous results of Isandhlwana&mdash;the winning
blow was still to be struck. It will be remembered
that after the fatal field of Isandhlwana no time had
been lost in applying to England for large reinforcements,
and the home authorities were in no
way slack in acceding to this urgent appeal. Lord
Chelmsford on his part was no less active in preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and getting these forces to the front, and
though to the ordinary observer there might seem
to be a period of inaction and sloth, since there was
indeed a necessary lull in active operations, yet in
reality no cessation of labour really occurred in any
of the military departments. Within one month
seventeen transports brought from England and
landed on the shores of South Africa more than 9000
troops and 2000 horses, and all the munitions and
stores, not only for the maintenance of such a force,
but also for other regiments at the front. As each
ship arrived at the outer anchorage, she was discharged
without difficulty, and in no case were the
troops kept on board an unnecessary hour, while in
no instance was any damage, accident, or loss sustained
during the process of disembarkation. To
the enterprise, energy, and forethought of the contractors
was due this satisfactory result; and the
timely engagement of all the available steam-tugs by
these authorities enabled them to carry out their
undertaking in a manner beyond the most sanguine
anticipations. In addition to the employment of
the tugs "Union," "Somtsen," "Adonis," and others,
the hulls of two fine schooners were prepared and
specially adapted for the accommodation of horses,
and these being lashed alongside the transports,
with the aid of steam-cranes and excellent wharves,
the rest was not a matter of difficulty. The weather,
most fortunately, was generally favourable, while
the equinoctial gales were so slight that the dreaded
bar was never quite impassable. There were at
this time no less than sixteen magnificent steam-transports,
some of them the largest afloat, lying at
the outer anchorage. Twenty-three vessels were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the inner harbour, and there were, irrespective of
local tenders and tugs, at least thirty vessels in the
roads. Such a sight had never been seen in the
colony, and Durban will never again exhibit such a
martial aspect. While from time to time returns
were issued of the reinforcements as they arrived,
no complete field state was made out till April 16th.
It will be well here to give a brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>. In the
"Egypt" and "Spain" were embarked at Southampton
the King's Dragoon Guards, whose muster-roll
gave 31 officers, 622 men, 91 officers' chargers,
and 480 troop-horses. In the "France" and
"England" were the 17th Lancers, numbering 31
officers, 622 men, 91 officer's chargers, and 480
troop-horses. These embarked at Blackwall and
Southampton. The "Manora" and "Olympus,"
from Southampton, brought M and N Batteries,
6th Brigade Royal Artillery, with 10 officers,
536 men, and 161 troop-horses. The "Palmyra,"
from Chatham, came with the 30th company
Royal Engineers, composed of 6 officers, 196
men, 2 officers' chargers, and 44 troop-horses.
The "City of Paris," from Queenstown, brought the
21st Royal North British Fusiliers, with 30 officers,
906 men, and 7 officers' chargers. The "Russia,"
from Portsmouth, embarked the 58th Foot, consisting
of 30 officers, 906 men, and 7 officers'
chargers; while the same vessel brought the 3rd
battalion 60th Rifles, with 30 officers, 906 men,
and 7 officers' chargers. From Ceylon came the
57th Foot, which, with drafts from England, made
up 30 officers, 906 men, and 7 chargers. The
"China," from Southampton, brought these drafts,
calling at Ceylon for the 57th. The same fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and roomy ship brought also from Southampton
the 94th Foot, with 30 officers, 906 men, and 7
chargers. The "City of Venice," from Queenstown,
brought the 3rd and 4th companies of the
Army Service Corps (transport branch); while the
"Queen Margaret," from Woolwich, brought No.
5 company of the same, the whole making up 19
officers, 550 men, and 480 horses. The "Palmyra,"
as well as the Engineers from Chatham, brought
4 officers and 140 men of the Army Hospital Corps
from Portsmouth. The numerical strength of these
reinforcements was therefore, according to return,
exactly as follows:&mdash;Cavalry, two regiments, making
1250 sabres; artillery, two batteries, 12 guns,
and 540 men; engineers, one company, 190 men;
infantry, six regiments, 5320 bayonets; Army
Service Corps and drafts, 1200; total, 8500 men
and 1871 horses. The two batteries of artillery
were not armed alike, the one being equipped
with the usual 9-pounder field-gun, and the
other having the six new 7-pounders similar
to those employed in Abyssinia, but mounted,
owing to the advice of General Sir John Bissett,
K.C.B., upon the tall and special Kaffrarian carriages
recently introduced into the service. These
carriages are totally different from the small 7-pounder
carriages with which the Abyssinian guns
were fitted, as they are raised upon wheels five feet
in height, the carriage, although lighter, being
exactly the same as to size as that used for the
9-pounder of eight cwt. These little guns, however,
weigh only 200 lb., and have rather a queer
dwarfed appearance mounted on their long axles,
between their tall wheels; but the plan was found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
many cases successful in this and late Kaffir campaigns,
owing to the obstacles presented to the
dwarfed carriage by the long grass so abundant in
all parts of the colony. Mules had also arrived for
these guns from Malta and Gibraltar. Most of the
regiments brought out their own equipment complete
and ready for the field&mdash;tents, waterproof
sheets, cooking utensils, barrack and camp stores&mdash;which
enabled them to be ready at once for the
forward movement. This arrangement was not
fully carried out by the Royal Artillery and Army
Service Corps, as they had a long train of carriages
to take to the front; but the company of the Army
Service Corps which came in the "Queen Margaret"
from Woolwich brought 100 splendid waggons, light
yet of great strength, and others came from Queenstown
in the "City of Venice." As the transports
engaged for the infantry regiments had a considerable
quantity of spare room for cargo, all the available
space was utilized for stores, munitions, and
supplies. Preserved meats, preserved vegetables,
and other victualling stores were landed in quantities
of an almost alarming nature, while about
twenty tons of 7-pounder shells had arrived by
the "Donald Currie," "Duart Castle," and other
hired transports.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the most interesting event to both
civil as well as military circles in Durban was the
arrival of the two cavalry regiments destined for the
front. The absence of cavalry was indeed one of
the great defects in our army, and had there been
previously a couple of regiments of real light cavalry
the progress of the campaign would doubtless have
taken a far more favourable turn, while some of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
misfortunes or disasters would never have happened.
The value of cavalry was so abundantly manifested
by the services of Piet Uys, Colonels Russell and
Buller, Major Barrow, and Captain Rowden, that it
would be idle to dwell upon the subject. In the
expedition, again, to Ekowe, how completely was the
value of this force shown by Major Barrow's horsemen!
This officer had not more than 200 sabres
with him, while at least half of these were natives;
but the completeness of the success achieved by
General Chelmsford was attributed in a great
measure by his lordship to the services of this
contingent, who were literally the eyes and ears
of the main column. They were, during the march,
effectually scouting the country around, ahead, and
in rear, and so constantly did they perform this
work that the Zulu spies, who swarmed around,
could not by any possibility get close enough to
learn the real strength of the column. Again, until
Zlobani, all or nearly all Wood's most brilliant successes
were gained by his mounted men, and he
himself never ceased deploring the absence of a
stronger body of horsemen. The "Spain" and
"Egypt," which brought out the King's Dragoon
Guards to their first South African service, two as
fine-looking vessels as ever floated in African seas,
both arrived and anchored in the outer roadstead
on Sunday morning, the 13th. The "Spain"
made a most successful voyage, having left Southampton
on the 27th of February, touched at St.
Vincent on 16th March, and arrived at Capetown
on 5th April. She had on board 312 troops and
286 horses. There was scarcely any sickness at all
on board during the voyage, and all the horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
both officers' chargers and troopers, were landed in
a very fair condition. The horses submitted to the
slinging, almost without an exception, with the
greatest docility, and the whole of them were landed
in a wonderfully short space of time, considering
the distance and the state of the weather. The
whole of the left wing of the regiment was on shore
by half-past five, and was at once marched to the
17th Lancers' encampment at the foot of the Berea.
The "Egypt" was a trifle less in tonnage than the
"Spain," but the difference would not be noticed
by an unprofessional eye. She had on board 20
officers, 300 troops, and 300 horses. Her horses
were also in excellent condition, and were all landed
on the 14th. By the 16th the men had quite
settled down in their new quarters at the cavalry camp
at the Berea, and everything was in the most admirable
order. The ground was admirably chosen for
the 1250 horsemen who were there under canvas,
and the considerations of water, wood, health, and
position were all carefully thought of and provided.
Each regiment was formed in column of troops,
occupying 172 yards of front and 130 yards of
depth. From the centre to centre of tents was ten
yards, and each horse picketed was allowed four
feet by twenty feet. In front of the camp was a
fine open space of level parade, which was employed
as a parade-ground for duty, and an agreeable
lounge and sort of out-door club after stable-hours.
The hours for <i>r&eacute;veille</i> and tattoo, the time for the
promulgation of orders, the arrangements for rations
and forage, the position of the brigade office, commanding
officer's tent, headquarters, commissariat
dep&ocirc;t, hospital and guards, the postal arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for letters and telegrams, the arrangements for
water for men and horses, the police arrangements,
the detail for guards and pickets, the detail of
other duties, and the statement of returns required,
were all noted in daily orders, and printed for circulation
amongst men and officers. By this means
a system of discipline was established as strict and
regular as if in presence of an enemy, and every
officer and non-commissioned officer was made acquainted
with the usual system of encampment
in his branch of the service, and the principles
which govern such arrangements, in regard particularly
to quickness of change and means of
transport, compactness, and safety from an enemy's
attack by day or surprise by night. On April 12th
General Lord Chelmsford and staff arrived back at
Durban by special train from the Lower Tugela, <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Jaccharine, at 6.45. With him were Colonel Crealock,
military secretary, Commodore Richards, and
Lieutenant Milne. A very large crowd was at the
station to greet the General.</p>

<p>Not the least notable figure among the brilliant
group who waited to receive the Commander-in-chief
was that of the Prince Imperial of France, whose
bright, intelligent face, as he conversed with Sir
John Bissett, was lit up with the anticipation of a
possible campaign.</p>

<p>Besides General Sir John Bissett and the Prince
Imperial, there were present at the railway station
Major-General Newdigate, Major-General Marshall,
Major-General Clifford, V.C., Colonel Bellairs, D.A.G.,
Colonel Riley, Major Huskisson, Captain Somerset,
Hon. W. Drummond, Captain Granville, and many
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The 19th of April was a day that will long be
remembered in Durban; for then was seen a sight
such as had never before been beheld in that town,
and probably will never be repeated. On that day
Lord Chelmsford inspected the two lately arrived
regiments of cavalry, the 17th Lancers and the
King's Dragoon Guards. As each regiment passed
before the General, it was noticed that its rear squadron
had attached to it half a company, and its usual
complement of store and supply waggons. These
consisted of four waggons, carrying three days'
supplies of food, and one day's oats for the horses,
four waggons for squadron equipments, such as tents,
blankets, and cooking utensils, together with one
headquarter waggon and one quarter-master's stores
waggon, making ten vehicles in all. Each of these
waggons was drawn by four horses, while the
armourers' forge waggon was drawn by six horses,
and the ambulance waggon by six fine mules.
Both regiments were in full dress, but in the lightest
possible marching order, but even in this, the men's
average weight was not less than 18 stone. The
regiments were both encamped at Cato Manor, which
is admirably suited to cavalry purposes, having good
grass and plenty of wood and water. The column
extended a long distance, and wound its way along
West Street, Abnel Street, Smith Street, past the
Royal Hotel and the new club, and <i>vi&acirc;</i> Field Street
back to the Manor, where the inspection and march
past were held in the presence of the General-in-chief.
The top of West Street was reached at half-past
seven, and here the largest crowd was assembled.
At the corner of Gardner Street the column was
joined by Lord Chelmsford, who was loudly cheered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
while handkerchiefs were waved from every carriage
and window. Outside the town gardens a number
of private carriages were drawn up, and each of
these was fully occupied by ladies in full toilette,
who seemed delighted at the novelty of the spectacle.
Such a sight as six hundred British cavalry seemed
to raise the enthusiasm of the townspeople to a great
pitch, and on all sides expressions of delight and
gratification at the fine and imposing appearance of
the two corps were freely vented. The entrance to
the picturesque grounds of the manor is situated
within easy walking distance of the town, but in
Natal few people ever think of pedestrian exercise,
so that the cavalcade was supplemented by almost an
equal number of mounted spectators of both sexes.
The cavalry brigade was, as soon as it entered the
manor, wheeled into line, and after receiving Lord
Chelmsford with a general salute, was minutely inspected
by his lordship, who expressed himself in the
most flattering terms to both Colonels Lowe and
Alexander, remarking particularly the excellent condition
of the 17th's horses. The Dragoons and
Lancers quitted Durban for Helpmakaar on April
24th, and every precaution was taken by easy
marching at first to avoid sore backs and girth galls.
Lord Chelmsford also left Durban, and proceeded to
Maritzburg: thence he travelled on to Dundee and
Utrecht, and then on to Wood's camp at Kambula,
where he arrived on May 3rd.</p>

<p>The main features of the plans for the fresh campaign
were, roughly speaking, as follows.</p>

<p>Two principal forces, operating from separate bases,
the one at Utrecht, and the other at Durban, were to
be held in communication by Wood, with a flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
column, and by Marshall's cavalry. The common
objective of these four columns was to be Ulundi,
the king's chief kraal. To keep up communications
with these two flanks, to make occasional raids and
dashes forward into the enemy's country, and at any
favourable moment to convert a feigned into a real
rush upon Ulundi, Wood was to retain his separate
and independent command. His force, however, was
to be largely reinforced, and more troops, if possible
cavalry, sent to him. The first column, as it was
called, under Major-General Hope Crealock, C.B.,
was to advance rapidly by the coast road, having as
its respective bases of operations Durban, Fort Pearson,
and Ginghilovo. The other column, under the
personal command of Lord Chelmsford, with Utrecht
as its principal base on the extreme north, was to
move also upon Ulundi. Meanwhile Wood, who had
been strongly reinforced, while nominally forming
part of Lord Chelmsford's headquarter division,
practically retained his independent command, and
formed a sort of flying column connecting the two
flanks with each other. No. 1 division, then preparing
for advance from the Lower Tugela, consisted
of three fine brigades. The First Brigade, commanded
by Colonel Pearson of Ekowe fame, consisted
of the 3rd Buffs, the 88th Connaught Rangers,
and the 99th Foot, each of these corps averaging
800 bayonets. The Second Brigade, under the command
of Colonel Pemberton, had in it the 57th, the
3rd battalion 60th Rifles, and the 91st Highlanders;
while the Third Brigade, under Colonel Law, had a
battery of Royal Artillery, the Naval Brigade from
the "Shah" and "Boadicea," at least 800 strong,
with four guns and two Gatlings, Barrow's Horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and a Native Contingent. Before the final advance
was made, it was determined that posts of communication
should be established at the Amatikula and
the Inyezani rivers, over which pontoon bridges were
to be constructed. Meanwhile for temporary purposes
there was constructed over the Amatikula
stream a cask bridge, by laying two slings, with eye
splices at one end, parallel to each other, at a distance
in proportion to the length of the casks. On these
ropes were placed as many casks as required, bungs
uppermost, and side by side. Across the upper surface
of the barrels balks were laid parallel to each
other, and the ends of the slings at each end of the
row of casks were brought up and fastened to the
ends of the balks. A small rope with an eye at each
end was fastened to each sling between each pair of
casks. These "braces," as they are technically
called, were then carried once round the nearest balk,
and afterwards passed over to the other side, carried
round the opposite braces, returned to its own side,
and finally made fast to the standing part of the
brace close below the balk by the assistance of two
half-hitches. Each pier of casks made in this fashion
can be completed in a marvellously short time by
skilled engineers, and in a reasonable period by
infantry who have been exercised at such work
under the supervision of their scientific comrades.
Transoms or beams connect each pier with its neighbour,
while chesses and outriggers can be laid down
as in a regular pontoon bridge. When crossing these
cask bridges great care, of course, has to be taken
by officers in charge of waggons and supplies to see
that no undue weight is carried beyond what must be
theoretically allowed by the practical methods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
calculating the relative buoyancy of the casks. In
addition to the redoubts thrown up to protect the
laagers at Amatikula and Inyezani, <i>t&ecirc;tes-de-pont</i>, or
bridge-heads, were also constructed to form a safeguard
for pontoons. The position on the Amatikula
was admirable. It was not too steep, having a hill
which formed as it were, a sort of natural glacis,
with a slope of not more than 10 deg., which is
about the most favourable for infantry. The post
could not be overlooked at any point by the enemy,
while the ground in front, being duly cleared, gave
no cover. The flanks rested upon natural obstacles
easily strengthened. The post on the Inyezani was
situated upon an eminence which fell away to the
rear, so that its second line and reserves could be
placed almost entirely under cover. A lake on one
side and a ravine on the other, both perpendicular to
the position, gave additional security to the fort, and
these were strengthened by every means at disposal.
In the armament of these works the guns were placed
<i>en barbette</i>, as being more suitable to distant fire, and
as our antagonists had no artillery with which they
could reply, no anxiety was entertained as to their
being dismounted. Guns, of course, which are fired
over a parapet instead of through an embrasure have
a far greater lateral range, and as the Zulu mode of
attack invariably includes rapid changes of front and
frequent flank movements, this mode of armament
was calculated to prove the most effective, as fire
could be brought to bear in all directions. A further
advantage is not to be lost sight of, and this is, that
guns fired over a parapet, or <i>en barbette</i>, are higher,
and could therefore plunge into such hollows as the
Zulus invariably made for when exposed to the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
fire. Gabions and screens of sandbags, to save the
men from undue exposure, were placed on each side
of the guns. While No. 1 column was thus employed
in fort-building, Lord Chelmsford was moving
from Utrecht to Kambula and Durnberg, where the
following corps were being concentrated, to form his
column:&mdash;General Newdigate's division, a formidable
body, consisting of the 2nd battalion 21st Fusiliers,
the 2nd battalion 24th, the 58th and 94th Regiments,
with M and N batteries 6th Brigade Royal Artillery:
Brigadier-General Evelyn Wood, V.C., who had now
with him the 13th and 90th Light Infantry Regiments,
Tremlett's battery of Royal Artillery, and
Buller's Light Horse, strongly augmented. Major-General
Marshall's cavalry brigade was also attached
to Lord Chelmsford's command, and was composed
of the King's Dragoon Guards, the 17th Lancers,
and Russell's Horse, lately augmented. Finally
Major-General the Hon. Hugh Clifford, V.C., C.B.,
whose former South African services go back to 1846,
remained in command of the base, dep&ocirc;t, and reserves
at Durban, with Major T. Butler, C.B., of Red River
and Ashanti fame, as chief of his staff.</p>

<p>It has been stated that one of the points at which
Crealock was to concentrate his forces was Ginghilovo;
but by the advice of high medical authorities,
Lord Chelmsford ordered the camp at Ginghilovo to
be broken up and shifted to a more favourable site
near the Inyezani. The Ginghilovo camp, as far as
strategical position was concerned, was all that the
most fastidious engineer could desire, but upon
sanitary grounds it was decidedly defective. It was
favourably sheltered in a sort of hollow having
defensive heights, which were to have been entrenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
on either side, but want of good water and
other reasons made it desirable to abandon the idea
of converting it into a permanent post. Two strong
laagers were now, therefore, constructed, the first
about seven miles beyond Tenedos, and the other
on the Inyezani river, a few miles from where
Pearson's first battle took place. The former of
these was called Fort Crealock, the latter Fort
Chelmsford. As far as position, and indeed construction,
Fort Chelmsford had many advantages
not possessed by Fort Crealock. The nature of the
soil upon which the latter had been built had much
to do with this; but there was but little choice in
the matter, as it was absolutely necessary that a
strong post should be built in this particular neighbourhood.
The soil from which most of the works
had been thrown up was unfortunately of a light,
sandy nature, and of that particular unbinding
description so disliked by engineers. The high
winds and rain which prevailed also quickly found
out the weak points in the armour of the fort, and
working parties were constantly employed in restoring
what had been blown down or washed away.
Fort Chelmsford, on the contrary, had the advantage
of a fine firm soil, neither too heavy nor too
light, while some quarries which had been found
within easy distance were of great assistance in
supplying the rev&ecirc;tements, galleries, and platforms.</p>

<p>The fort itself was situated in a most picturesque
part of the country. The pass leading into the
valley through which the river runs was most
romantic, winding through a delightful parklike
country, crossed by rapid streams of clear, ice-cold
water, and, as it narrowed became quite precipitous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the road dwindling to a mere footpath, so narrow
that mounted men could not ride more than two
abreast. The kloof was flanked on the precipice
side by loose masses of rock, intermingled with trees
and bush, and tangled with monkey-ropes and
creepers of all kinds. The lower side sloped suddenly
with a fall of about sixty feet to the bottom of
the valley, where a rapid mountain stream, gurgling
as it rushes over its rocky bed, fell soothingly upon
the ear with a most dreamy yet refreshing sound.
The other road to the fort passed through a still
more beautiful valley, leading to the Inyezani kloof
by a path cut in the precipitous face of the hill,
whose sides were clothed with "spekboem" (elephant
bush) and all kinds of flowering shrubs. The
road looked down a declivity of some 200 feet, and
was worn in places into a perfect staircase of
boulders by successive torrents of tropical rain, and
would be quite impracticable for any other species of
vehicle than a Cape waggon. The edge facing the
precipice had no kind of parapet, and the dangerous
nature of the pass was brought into still greater
prominence by the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of an ox waggon still lying
broken up in minute particles at the bottom of the
valley, where it had evidently gone down bodily
with its span of oxen. The pass was, however, in
spite of its danger, very beautiful. Convolvuli ran
over the bushes in rich clusters, the star-shaped
jessamine, with its pink undersides, and the magnificent
specimens of mesembryanthemums, or fig-marigolds,
of which there are hundreds of different
species, having little transparent pellicles, containing
pure liquid, scattered over the leaves, giving them
the appearance of being sprinkled over with ice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
scarlet geraniums, attaining a height of ten or
twelve feet amidst the thick bush, glowed on every
side.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Wood had been no less busy
in and around his camp at Kambula. On April 17th
he made a reconnaissance, at Lord Chelmsford's suggestion,
to the Blood river, where a site had been
chosen for a permanently entrenched camp, to serve
as a large dep&ocirc;t for the main body of the army.
The ride was about fifteen miles, and the General
and his party passed through some beautiful valleys,
and through a path cut in the precipitous face of a
pass whose sides were clothed with "spekboem"
(elephant bush) and various other flowering shrubs.
After four miles' cantering, they came to a part of
the road which looked down a declivity of some 200
feet. The scene was, however, most picturesque.
Convolvuli, the star-shaped jessamine, and the
magnificent Strelitzia Reginae flourished around,
while scarlet geraniums attained to a height
unthought of in England. Two excellent sites for
outposts were selected, by which communication
could be kept up with the large dep&ocirc;t and Kambula.
These had commanding positions, and subsequently
stone buildings were solidly constructed, square in
form, but loopholed and flanked by ditch <i>caponni&egrave;res</i>,
while each fort contained accommodation for
mounted men and a detachment of infantry. The
Blood river, like most South African streams, is
subject to great fluctuations. At that period,
owing to recent rains, it was in flood, and in many
places twenty and thirty feet deep, running with a
powerful current that rendered it most dangerous to
cross. The banks in most places are dangerously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
high, and the sides are steeply scarped by the force
of the stream. Fording-places only occur at long
intervals, so that when crossing in a flood, it is not
at all easy to hit them off, while if once carried down
by the force of the current the traveller has very
little chance of escaping an accident. The best way
of crossing a flooded river, and that which was
adopted by regulation in Wood's column, is the
Kaffir plan of taking off some way up the stream,
and so making a good allowance for driftage. Old
settlers and Boers often undress themselves completely
before mounting their horses, and carry their
clothes and arms in a bundle on top of their heads,
in case of a capsize. The stirrups should, of course,
be crossed over the pommel of the saddle, and the
horse allowed to have his head, the rider guiding
him by the snaffle, while in difficult cases it is better
for him to relieve his animal of weight altogether by
floating alongside and guiding his head in the proper
direction. The Blood river flows through some
fine scenery, bordered, however, at times by impenetrable
bush and tangled vegetation of all descriptions,
again winding under lofty mountains of
basaltic rock, beautifully variegated with foliage,
the thickets affording shelter to swarms of animal
and insect life, giving rise on a still evening to a
perfect babel of sound, amidst which the plaintive
coo of the ringdove, the incessant chirp of the cicala,
the twittering of many-plumaged birds, and the
hoarse challenge of the bull-frogs are pre-eminent.
Conspicuous among the birds are to be noticed
especially the little crested kingfisher, showing a
perfect gem of colour, several varieties of sugarbird&mdash;a
species somewhat allied to the hummingbirds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
or "hoverers," which are constantly to be
seen flying restlessly over the aloe blossom&mdash;the
orange-throated lark, the blue jay, and the Zulu
finch, whose black and white plumage and red throat
are set off by his long, streaming tail, the feathers
of which are so prolonged that when flying they
nearly overbalance him. The sandy plain on which
the first fort was built was covered with stunted
karoo bush, and was full of Duyker gries-buck and
bush-buck, while two kinds of hares frequented the
plain, the larger kind grey-furred like the English
rabbit, and a small red mountain species, much
better eating than the former, but which is scarcely
considered fit for the European table, on account of
its scavenging propensities.</p>

<p>Colonel Buller's Frontier Light Horse was also
largely reinforced, its last augmentation being
Captain Marshall's new troop of eighty well-armed
and well-mounted men. A corps of Natal Mounted
Kaffirs, principally recruited from the Edendal
Mission-station, had also been added to this command,
and they were found most trustworthy and
intelligent. They were armed with the short
Martini-Henry carbine, and drilled with equal steadiness
to the European troopers.</p>

<p>Buller's Light Horse were destined to play so
important a part in the final advance on Ulundi,
that a short description of their appearance and
equipment will not here be out of place. The first
requisite was a well-built, sober, and intelligent
horseman, who in addition to being able to shoot
with the Martini-Henry, knew also how to groom,
saddle, and nurse his horse. This was required to
be an animal neither leggy, long-tailed, nor showy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
but a clever, cobby sort of quadruped, who could
climb like a cat, and obey its master like a well-broken
spaniel, endued with a sound constitution,
stout and wiry, and with a good turn of speed. The
saddlery was, as far as possible, of a uniform pattern,
and selected with considerable judgment and care.
The great points were that the tree should be wide
enough in the fork not to pinch the shoulders, but
yet not so wide as to let the saddle right down on
the withers, with the seat long enough to sit in
comfortably and to spread the weight to some
extent over the horse's back. As many of the Cape
horses are buck-jumpers, slightly-padded flaps were
in vogue, although not insisted upon. They are a
great protection to the knees in riding through
bush. The saddle, of course, was provided with
wallets in front, which contained a couple of pairs
of socks, one flannel shirt, a tooth-brush, towel, and
piece of yellow soap. Saddle-bags were worn only
when going on distant expeditions, but a tin mug,
knife, fork, and spoon, revolver, and flint and steel
formed the invariable equipment of these troopers,
and with a cloak or blanket <i>&agrave; discr&eacute;tion</i> made up the
weight carried by the horse. Although the mounted
infantry were volunteers drawn from various line
regiments, there was sufficient leaven of the cavalry
element to insure efficiency in the mounted duties.
When the corps was first raised any kind of dress
was worn, but fashion subsequently exerted its sway,
and a rather picturesque "get-up" became almost
universally adopted. Broad-leaved felt hats, with
coloured puggarees, brown cord breeches, "baggy"
to the last degree, and so patched with untanned
leather that the original material had almost disappeared;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
a sort of patrol jacket, all over pockets,
dyed mimosa colour, and also patched with leather
of any colour on the shoulders and wherever the gun
was accustomed to rest, brown laced gaiters, coming
high up the leg, and even thighs, and a rough
coloured flannel shirt, entirely open at the neck;
such was the most usual costume. The rifles were
of various patterns&mdash;long Martinis, Martini-Henry
carbines, some of Sharpe's old-pattern Sniders, and
Snider carbines. No bucket, however, was ever
used, as it was considered better that a man unencumbered
with a long sabre should have his weapon
slung to his body, and not to his horse.</p>

<p>Another business that had also engaged Wood's
time and attention was the shifting of his camp.
In point of fact, in spite of every precaution
taken, it was impossible to disguise the unpleasant
fact that the very air around the Kambula camp
was tainted with blood and putridity, while in the
crevices and amidst the long, dank grasses which
concealed the bodies of those who after the battle
crawled away to die unseen, lurked the unmistakable
odour of human decay and putrefaction. These
were the principal reasons which induced our chief
to consult with the medical authorities upon the
advisability of moving away to fresh ground, and
this determination arrived at, its execution was not
delayed for an hour. In point of position, the site
of our present laager was preferable to the one
quitted. The move was commenced and finished on
the same day, the 14th, and there was every reason
to be satisfied with the change. For beauty of site,
as well as strategical considerations, the position
could scarcely be surpassed. It was as nearly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
possible a mile and a quarter west from the old
camp, and towards the north-west the view was
indeed splendid. In front, and across the river, lay
a grassy plain, dotted pleasantly here and there with
mimosa and camel-thorn. This plain is hemmed in
by the Zlobani mountains, on the right by the spurs
of the Inhlomiga, and away to the left by the towering
heights of the Makamba, rising to 4000 feet
above the sea level. The plain narrows backwards
between the ranges into a "poort" or valley, which,
as it recedes away from the fort, presents a gloomy
and terrific aspect of solitude. Through it, and
winding in and out amongst tall boulders of rock,
and under dangerous precipices, past wild and gorgeous
hollows, rank with the semi-tropical vegetation
so peculiar to this part of the country, runs a
small footpath, by which, through heavy clumps of
thorny bush and over naked rock-bound ridges, the
explorer reaches the fertile valley, over which till
lately frowned the stronghold of Umbelini. To the
north, and trending northwards ten or twelve miles,
spread the Elandsberg mountains, the lower portion
of whose sides are clothed with bush, presenting a
sombre aspect, but the upper portions of which,
formed of huge crags and scarped walls of granite
and porphyry, glitter grandly in the sun, affording a
glorious and ever-changing panorama, stretching out
for miles to where the range terminates near the
Pongolo river.</p>

<p>The new fort was not so elaborate in its design as
the last, though, perhaps, as a defensive work more
formidable. It was a six-angled enclosure, about
sixty yards wide, having a wide and deep ditch,
drawbridge, and platform. From its eastern angles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
projected two long curtain walls, which enclosed a
roomy and well-guarded "kraal" for cattle and
horses. These curtain walls were protected by the
fire of the angles from which they sprung, and the
cattle enclosure did not in the least interfere with
the <i>enceinte</i>, as it had its own gateway and drawbridge.
At the end of the kraal furthest from the
fort was a sort of irregular redoubt, with a deep
ditch and earthen walls revetted with gabions, and
defended by a formidable lot of cactus and thorns
laid along the parapet. This constituted the fort,
which was situated on a flat plateau overhanging a
sharp bend of the river, which, being commanded by
the guns, afforded a fine supply of water and an
excellent bathing-place for the officers and men.
This change caused a great improvement in the
health of the division generally, and especially
amongst the invalids in hospital. The deaths
reported up to this period were the following: the
Hon. Rudolph Gough, from dysentery; Lieut.
Alderton, drowned; Captain Sandham, of the 90th,
and Assistant Commissary Phillimore, of fever;
Privates Achmuty and Moone, 13th Light Infantry,
of wounds received at Kambula.</p>

<p>On the 16th April there occurred an event
that caused a great sensation in the camp, the
history of which throws into the shade so many
tales of romance and fictions of adventures in savage
lands, and narrow escapes by flood and field, that it
deserves to be recorded at length.</p>

<p>Among the fifty horsemen who rode under the
command of poor Weatherly there were no better
soldiers nor more popular comrades in their corps
than two young Frenchmen, named respectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Ernest Grandier, a well-made, athletic, and powerful
trooper, and Cramazan Baudoin, a stout and equally
stalwart fellow. Both these men were natives of
Bordeaux, and had come out to the colony together
about five years before with the intention of trying
their fortunes in the wine trade. They had both
served their time in the French army, and when the
present war commenced could not resist the temptation
of seeing service under such a gallant commander
as Weatherly, whose knowledge of France
and the Continent generally obtained him many
excellent French and German recruits. On the day
of the Zlobani attack, owing to a thick fog which
suddenly came on, Colonel Weatherly's troops
missed their road and were unable to effect the
junction with Buller ordered by Colonel Wood.
The Zlobani mountain was successfully carried by
Colonel Buller and his horsemen at daylight on
the 28th March, and Colonel Wood, who was with
Russell's horsemen a few miles to the west, pushed
forward on the same morning with his usual small
escort of the 90th mounted men and overtook
Weatherly, who had been all night trying to find
the path. After the summit of the mountain had
been gained, under a heavy fire, during which
Captain Ronald Campbell and Mr. Lloyd were killed,
Colonel Weatherly was ordered to move round to
the other flank, and make good his retreat by the
eastern side of the mountain. In endeavouring to
effect this movement they became surrounded and
cut off by Zulus in front and rear. Weatherly was
killed in the endeavour to save his son; a few of
the troopers managed to cut their way, under the
most terrible difficulties, through the bloodthirsty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hordes hemming them in on the far east of the
mountain; and Grandier and his friend, who had
promised to keep together, found themselves, with
a couple more of their comrades, in the midst of
about a hundred yelling Zulus, while the bodies of
their slaughtered friends were being hurled over the
rocks on every side. Grandier, although slightly
wounded in the side and wrist, was still mounted,
but Baudoin's horse had been shot early in the day,
and he was, bruised and blown, about to fall into
the hands of the pursuers, when his gallant comrade
sprang off his stout little horse and placed the fugitive
upon the saddle, intending to mount also as
soon as more favourable ground could be reached.
He saw, besides, that two of his comrades were not
far in front, and twice called upon them to turn and
make a stand. Unfortunately, the shouts of the
Zulus and the clang of the conflict drowned his
voice, and they rode on, while Baudoin in the meanwhile
was compelled by a fresh rush of Zulus to
turn up another path. Grandier now endeavoured
to follow the two horsemen on foot, and being
tolerably fresh he managed for some little time to
keep on his legs. Passing some large rocks, however,
which jutted out half across the pathway, a
large piece of stone was hurled at him from above,
and felled him to the ground, and while half-stunned
and insensible, he was overtaken by half-a-dozen
savages, and after receiving several severe blows
from knobkerries, was seized and pinioned with
thongs. Even as they lifted him, he could see in
the distance that Baudoin had managed to gain
the troopers in advance, and the three seemed to
have some chance of escape. Umbelini's "big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
place," or kraal, is on the south side of the Zlobani,
and rather more than half way up from the valley.
To this place, with a considerable amount of abuse,
Grandier was led. Wounded as he was, beaten,
bruised, and footsore, the prisoner was dragged
round the slopes of the mountain, and forced by
assegais to keep up with his escort, who, like all their
countrymen, went at a sort of double stride or trot
until the outskirts of the kraal were reached. The
sun was still high over the mountain when they
reached Umbelini's stronghold, and he was at once
placed under an escort in one of the Zulu huts,
which formed part of the outer circle of the defences.
It was constructed of strong wickerwork, and
thatched with reeds and long grass, the door being
merely a small matted hurdle, which did not so
entirely block the doorway as to prevent those outside
from looking in&mdash;an advantage of which the
crowd of men, women, and children did not fail to
avail themselves to the fullest extent. The walls
were so thin that voices and conversation, even
though carried on in a moderate tone, could be distinctly
heard from hut to hut. After having been
kept without food or water for some hours, Grandier
was brought the same evening before the chief,
Umbelini, whose appearance he described as at the
same time villainous and ferocious in the extreme.
The interview was certainly an interesting one.
The name and power of the ex-Swazi chief were
known and renowned all over Zululand. The recent
favour shown to him by Cetywayo, and his position
being now considered as more that of an ally than a
vassal, gave to his authority and prestige an influence
they had never before possessed. So blindly did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
his people believe in him, that it is more than probable
had further success crowned his efforts, he
would have been found a dangerous rival for the
Zulu throne. Umbelini sat in front of the principal
hut, surrounded by about fifty of his favourite
warriors, while large numbers of savages appeared
to be leaving the kraal in different directions.
Masses of natives, evidently belonging to outlying
tribes, were continually arriving, and reports were
brought from time to time to the chief, who gave
his orders rapidly and without hesitation. Upwards
of a hundred principal men appeared to be in conference
with Umbelini, and the number seemed
rapidly increasing. Many of these men, Grandier
had reason to believe, were ambassadors from
Cetywayo, and officers belonging to the force he
sent to assist in Wood's destruction. A covering
of skins was fastened round the waist of each, and
broad rings of copper were worn round the ankles
and arms of those of the highest rank. Plumes of
feathers adorned the heads of others who were more
scantily clad, and who were evidently dressed for
battle; while others again wore, something after the
fashion of a Hungarian pelisse, skins of panthers or
other striped animals. The array of dusky savages
was certainly imposing, and it was doubtless
arranged with a view to effect. Each left hand
supported a shield of tanned buffalo hide, surmounted
with plumes of ostrich feathers. The
same hand grasped a long bunch of assegais, while
the right held the short stabbing-spear. Round
the necks of those of high rank was usually a necklace,
made of some wild animal's or possibly human
teeth, from which hung a long knife or dagger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
About half of these warriors carried fire-arms, which
were, however, of every conceivable make and pattern.
The enclosure into which the prisoner was
conducted, or rather hurled, was formed of the
branches of the mimosa, strongly and tightly interlaced,
and from the height at which it stood a
splendid view could be obtained. All round were
situated the huts of the tribe, looking like large-sized
beehives, while close to each was a little walled
space, in which the family wealth, consisting of oxen
and other cattle, was kept. Umbelini, in spite of
the sinister and ferocious aspect he wore, was not
without a certain savage dignity which evidently impressed
not only his own people, but also the indunas
from Cetywayo. Perhaps the consciousness of their
presence, and the knowledge that this scene would
be reported to headquarters, gave an increase of
grave majesty to his manner, and rendered him less
repulsive in his action and speech. There was a
certain air of thought, and even command in his
face, which was in striking contrast to those around
him. His hair was plastered with the usual circlet
of red clay, but his forehead was encircled with a
fillet of young ostrich feathers, terminating in a
single plume hanging behind. Heavy rings of
polished metal spanned the thick part of his arms,
and lighter ones of the same material were round his
waist. The neck, thick, massive, and bull-like, was
adorned with a necklace formed of human teeth,
from which hung the usual knife, while over the
broad black and hairy breast swept a splendid
ostrich feather. In the right hand he held his only
weapon, a kind of short but deadly knobkerrie,
while his left hand rested upon his naked knee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
But for the low forehead, the large mouth, and the
enormous under-hanging animal lip, Umbelini might
be described as a fine, indeed splendid specimen of
the South African warrior.</p>

<p>A chief named Nyamba, who had spoken a few
words of English to Grandier, now explained to
Umbelini who the prisoner was, and under what
circumstances he had been taken, and at his suggestion
a Zulu named Nicohlomba, who was known to
have once lived in Natal, was brought into the
enclosure as an interpreter. "What have your
English dogs done with the traitor Oham?" was
the first question asked by the chief. "I hear the
English are going to make him king in our land."
Grandier, with composure, replied he knew nothing
of Oham or the intentions of Government. "What
has become of Somtsen (Shepstone)?" was the
next query, and then, when the prisoner said he was
equally ignorant on that point, a whispered conversation
took place between the two chiefs, who
ordered Grandier to be taken back out of earshot,
while the indunas were called up to confer. After
five minutes' anxious deliberation, the prisoner was
again called up, and severely and minutely questioned
as to the numerical force at Kambula camp,
and as to who was in command. Through the Zulu
interpreter, whose English was not much better than
that of the younger chief, Grandier explained that
he was but a simple trooper fighting for his daily
pay, and knew little or nothing of the questions
demanded. Umbelini, who had been hitherto seated,
rose up, looked round the circle, and all at once
poured forth a torrent of words, which seemed to
have a wonderful effect upon the crowd. He seemed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
as far as Grandier could glean, from the few Zulu
sentences he knew, to be a sort of welcome to some
honoured arrivals (probably the indunas from
Ulundi), and when the Swazi chief had finished, a
young Zulu chief named Umlambongwenya (the
Great Alligator) stepped forward and warmly congratulated
Umbelini on the battle of the previous
day, and, pointing to the prisoner, added some
request. The circle of warriors loudly applauded,
striking their shields, and this brought a large
increase of numbers to the enclosure, where the
applause became almost deafening. Grandier now
fancied that his hour was come, and prepared to
meet his death like a brave man; but to his astonishment,
he was taken out of the enclosure, and
once more bound to a heavy log or stump outside
the hut, where he was allowed a little milk and a few
husks of maize. When the next day came, at daybreak,
he was again brought forth to be examined.
A circle was now formed round the unfortunate
prisoner, who was firmly bound with thongs of raw
hide to a stout tree in the centre, while round and
round the youngest of the warriors danced, chanting
a melancholy dirge, and keeping time upon his
naked body with the butt ends of their stabbing
assegais. Suddenly these proceedings were disturbed
by the arrival of a new actor upon the
scene. A tall and elderly savage, almost a skeleton
in attenuation, bounded into the inner circle. This
creature, who was a sort of witch doctor, prophet,
and sorcerer, commenced to execute a species of
weird dance, spinning round the circle like a teetotum,
and uttering all the time hideous and guttural
sounds. All the warriors now remained silent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
crouched down, still keeping the circle intact, and
kept time to the old savage's dance by monotonously
beating the hard ground with their knobkerries.
Again did the wretched prisoner, now almost worn
out by cold, hunger, and thirst, believe that the
torture was about to commence, and once more was
he agreeably disappointed, for, stopping suddenly in
the midst of his mad antics, the sorcerer flung himself
violently at the feet of Umbelini, and breaking
as he did so a necklace of human bones which he
wore, pointed over his head towards the east, where
the sun was now lighting up the hills and valleys
towards Ulundi, in which direction, coming across
one of the mountains some ten miles off, could be
seen, so clear was the pure atmosphere, a huge and
dusky column, marching with a cloud of skirmishers
running along the terraces of the rocks lower down.
These were evidently the advanced guard of the
impi promised by Cetywayo to Umbelini for the
destruction of Wood's kraal; and as the troops
came nearer and more into the sunlight, the principal
warriors round Umbelini executed a war-dance
round the sorcerer and Grandier, who had now
given up all hope. The savages yelled, leaped,
threw themselves bodily into the air, and went
through all the motions of savage conflict, gesticulating,
threatening, pursuing, stabbing the fallen,
and rehearsing, in fact, the performance they soon
expected to go through at the expense of the
British soldiers.</p>

<p>The advent of the coming reinforcements caused
the wildest excitement in the camp of Umbelini, and
the horror of Grandier's impending death was
infinitely aggravated by the helplessness he felt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
not being able to give any warning to his gallant
chief and comrades. Still he was in some degree
consoled by the subsequent reflection that his commander
at Kambula was a most unlikely man to be
caught unawares, and he therefore resigned himself
calmly to his fate. He was not left long in doubt
as to his destination, for the chief, Umbelini, considered
that it would be a compliment to Cetywayo
to send him a white prisoner. While waiting, however,
to be taken to Ulundi, he could not avoid
seeing the preparations for the forthcoming attack,
and, before his departure he witnessed the march of
Cetywayo's impi towards Kambula. Before commencing
the journey, his guards carefully stripped
him of all his clothes, which they divided amongst
themselves and wore, and likewise compelled him
to carry their food. For four days, quite naked,
with the exception of his hat and a pocket handkerchief,
which he had tied round his waist, he was
compelled by his inhuman escort to keep up with
their rapid pace. Barefooted, black and blue with
bruises, and still suffering from exposure and want
of nourishment, this brave and devoted soldier bore
up against his torture. Each night he received a small
handful of green mealies, and was bound tightly
with sharp and cutting thongs to a thorn bush; and
while he reposed, taking it in turns, one of his guards
always kept watch over him. Now and then a kraal
was passed on the road, and here old women and
children, the only creatures who seemed left, came
out and reviled and scratched him. On the fourth
day, towards sundown, Grandier could tell, from
what he overheard, that they were drawing near to
the king's kraal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>When close to the king's kraal, on the afternoon
of the fourth day's journey, one of Grandier's escort
went forward to announce his arrival; and after
suffering the usual torment of being tied all night
to a tree (this time his clothes, now torn to rags,
being given to him), on the next day at noon he
was brought before the king, whom he described as
a stout, medium-sized man, not so fat, however, or
so tall as his brother Oham. Almost the same
questions were now put to the prisoner as he had
previously declined to answer at Zlobani, and this
time the conversation was carried on by means of a
man who had the appearance of a mongrel Dutchman,
who was known to belong to Cetywayo's staff.
In speaking of his brother Oham the king seemed
greatly enraged, and he vowed with many emphases
that he would mete out a terrible punishment to
him and the dogs who had dared to invade his
country. Grandier, on being pressed, saw no reason
to deny the strength of General Wood's force or the
name of its commander, and he set it down at 4000
men, at which the king seemed astonished.</p>

<p>Grandier described the king as having frequent
interviews with him, during which time he would
have colonial newspapers, of which there were a
quantity, translated to him. This fact will probably
be taken as the means by which he had been able
to learn Lord Chelmsford's movements; and if he
read the contemptuous tone in which our soldiers
were spoken of by these journals, it would, in a
great measure, account for the poor opinion he
seemed, till Ginghilovo and Kambula, to entertain
of our commanders. The king made frequent overtures
to his prisoner, to induce him to join his army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and offered him wives, cattle, and land if he could
assist his half-caste Portuguese armourer in unspiking
the two guns taken at Isandula. These
interviews continued for several days, and finally,
when nothing could be obtained by the offered
bribes, he was relegated to a hut, where, bound
each night with painfully tight thongs, he was
watched by relays of old women&mdash;hideous hags,
whose amusement was to tear out his hair and stick
pins into him whenever he endeavoured to sleep.
In the daytime, during eight days, he was regularly
tied to a tree, and beaten by assegais by every
warrior whose fancy it was to pass that way, the
offers, however, being daily repeated. At last
came a messenger with the news of the Kambula
battle, the Zulu defeat, and the deaths of Umbelini
and his brother; and the king's grief first, and rage
afterwards, exceeded all bounds. Grandier was then
ordered to be reconducted to Umbelini's kraal, and
there to be tortured and put to death as a sacrifice
to the spirit of Umbelini, and on the following
morning, at daybreak, he was sent off, fortunately
with an escort of only two men, each armed with
assegais, and one with a muzzle-loading rifle. After
ten miles' journey, the chief Inyaneme was met
returning to Ulundi, and he was informed by
Grandier's escort of the fate awarded to him. About
midday on the 13th Grandier, worn out with heat
and thirst, bleeding and swollen feet, and nearly
starved, sank upon the veldt, and said he could go
no further. He was then severely beaten, so
severely that he fainted; and his guards, fearing he
would die in their hands, gave him some water, and
took him to a ripe mealy field to eat. Being a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of iron constitution, he was soon revived; while,
having his wits about him, he thought that now or
never was his hope of liberty. When he had eaten
a few mealies he returned to his escort, and found
them reclining&mdash;the most dangerous antagonist, the
man with the rifle, being in a sort of half-doze,
while his comrade, who had just finished his midday
meal, was employed in packing away the remnants.
Pretending to totter, Grandier sank upon the ground,
as near as possible to the man with the gun, and
while affecting to sleep, saw that no suspicion was
aroused. The gun could not be reached, but the
assegais were not far, and better, he thought, would
be a bold struggle for life, even if he failed and was
killed in the encounter, than the agony of slow
torture he would otherwise endure. Watching his
opportunity, and while the least drowsy Zulu was
turning his head to take some snuff from the little
horn usually worn in the ear, Grandier leant silently
over, and noiselessly removing the stabbing assegai
from under the arm of the man with the gun, with
both his hands, for they were still tied, he nerved
himself with the courage of despair, and throwing
his whole weight into the blow, pinned the sleeping
Zulu to the ground, while at the same instant he
seized the gun. The shock was fortunately so
great that the thongs were burst, and he had time
to face the other savage with the loaded weapon,
and both wrists free. This spectacle so astonished
the Zulu, that, giving one glance at his impaled
comrade, he darted away without attempting to
fight. Grandier, of course, saw the imprudence of
risking a shot, so first despoiling the dead man of
his ammunition, he crept away, and took refuge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the nearest bush. After the excitement of the last
hour he was not sorry to obtain some rest; accordingly
he lay down for twenty minutes or half an
hour, and then thought he might venture to reconnoitre
as far as the top of the hill. He saw nothing;
so, making his way back to the bush, he remained
till dark, when he made up his mind to travel all
night, finding his way luckily by his knowledge of
the position of the constellations. The next day
from a high cliff he watched a large body of Zulus
quite close to him underneath, driving cattle in the
direction from which he had come, and he consequently
did not venture to move out of a cave he
had found till they were well out of sight. For two
nights, and while subsisting on the small store of
mealies he had taken from the dead Zulu, he
travelled, fortunately in the right direction, but
with more than one narrow escape on nearing Zulu
kraals. On Wednesday, the 16th of April, just
three days after his escape from his guards, this
brave and resolute man espied, away in the distance,
what to his practised eye was a European scout.
Fortunately he was seen. As the remainder of the
patrol came up to him he fell, bleeding and exhausted,
but undaunted, at the feet of some of Ralf's Horse,
who were exploring, and was by them carried back
to Wood's camp, where after some days in hospital
he was able to resume duty and share in the final
attack on Ulundi.</p>

<p>A very few days after the battle of Kambula
sufficed to clear the neighbourhood of Zulus, though
occasionally skirmishes kept occurring farther off;
and the latest news received was that Captain
Prior, of the 80th Foot, proceeding with a mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
patrol from Luneberg in the direction of the Upper
Pongolo Drift, had fallen in with Umbelini's force.
Having trotted about ten miles from Luneberg he
came up with about twenty friendly natives, who
informed him that a band of Zulus were sweeping
horses and cattle from the valley. Guided by these
people, he made such good use of his time that he
soon came within 800 yards of the marauders, who
were driving away a large quantity of horses and
cattle. Captain Prior charged into and dispersed
them, recapturing eighteen horses and a number of
cattle, and, leaving these in charge of Lieutenant
Ussher, he continued the pursuit, killing several of
the enemy, amongst whom was a younger son of
Usirayo. It has since been ascertained that Umbelini
was of the party, and was so badly wounded
in the skirmish, that he subsequently died in a cave
where he took refuge. This Zulu party was subsequently
ascertained to be a portion of the force that
fought at Zlobani, and one of the recaptured horses
was recognized as belonging to a mounted private
of the 80th, attached to Russell's Mounted Infantry.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of May 3rd, Lord Chelmsford, with
Prince Louis Napoleon, Colonel Crealock, and
Captain Molyneux, arrived at Wood's camp at
Kambula. His lordship went round the camp soon
after his arrival, and expressed himself uncommonly
pleased with all the arrangements for the discipline
and internal economy of the laager, being particularly
struck with the quiet and easy way in which
all the duties were carried on, without noise, excitement,
or delay of any kind. The whole force was
paraded in the afternoon for the General's inspection,
and his lordship took the opportunity of saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a few well-chosen and appropriate words to each
corps.</p>

<p>On the following morning (Sunday), after divine
service was over, Lord Chelmsford suggested to
General Wood that it would be advisable to make
a reconnaissance in the direction of the White
Umvolosi valley in view of choosing a suitable
position for an entrenched camp within easy communication
of Durnberg and Conference Hill. The
day was fine and pleasant, and Buller, who had
proceeded in advance with a number of his scouts,
soon signalled back that the patrol were watched by
a number of Zulus, who now and then exchanged
shots with his men from the neighbouring hills.
After riding about three miles towards the south-east
in the direction of the Zinguin Neck and
Tonguin mountain, the party entered a rugged
part of the country near where the White Umvolosi
takes its rise, passing along by a winding road,
flanked on either side by the usual mimosa thorns,
when suddenly was heard the "whirr! whirr!" of
a couple of leaden messengers, though as yet nothing
in the shape of an enemy could be seen. In a short
time, however, Wood, who had cantered on in front,
saw with his practised eye sundry copper-coloured
bodies creeping along in the bushes below about half
a mile off. They were so intent upon watching Wood
and his group of horsemen that they did not at first
see that about a score of Buller's men had gained
their flank, and almost cut them off. It was a most
exciting scene as the mounted scouts were observed
looking about for something in the shape of a path
by which to descend the cliff which formed at this
part almost a sheer precipice of some 300 feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
They, however, managed the descent by a rough
cattle-path, sending down showers of loose stones
and <i>d&eacute;bris</i> before them as their horses half slid, half
scrambled to the base. All this time the main body
were crossing a wide plateau dominating the White
Umvolosi valley and the river, which wound away
at the base of the cliff. Looking over the precipitous
sides, they could perceive a small herd of cattle
penned up in a kraal in the centre of a little bush-covered
flat adjoining the stream. As it was thought
just possible that they might capture some prisoners,
and obtain information of what Zulu forces were in
the neighbourhood, and as cattle-hunting is one of
the great ends of Zulu warfare, half a dozen of the
General's escort were detached to see what they
could effect. Getting down the cliff as well as they
could, and then winding through the dense thorns
in the valley, they soon found the kraal, and, having
collected the cattle, began to return. But this was
certainly a puzzle upon which they had not calculated.
To ascend the cliff by the way they had
come was impossible, whilst on the other side ran
the river, wide, and apparently very deep. Undoubtedly
the only way out of the difficulty was to
find a ford. They were, therefore, busily occupied
in searching for one, when they perceived a mounted
scout, sent by Buller, on the other side of the stream,
who was gesticulating very excitedly, and trying to
warn them of some danger. As it was impossible
at the distance to hear what he said, one of the
mounted men was sent down to the bank, and he
came back with the news that the bush behind was
full of Zulus. The warning did not come a moment
too soon, for within fifty yards of them came a crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of naked savages, yelling and flourishing their
assegais and rifles, in evident triumph at the success
of their stratagem. Shouting, therefore, to the
men who were staying behind with the cattle, the
rest put spurs to their horses and galloped along
the banks of the river, looking out all the time for
any sign of a ford by which they might cross. Fortunately
this situation was seen by that portion of
the party who had gone round by the opposite bank,
and they had come down to meet their comrades,
having hit upon a ford higher up the stream. It
was, however, a close shave, so close indeed that by
the time they had reached the other side of the
river by the ford, which was up to the horses'
girths, and which they splashed through at a gallop,
the Zulus had actually reached the bank, and were
only prevented from capturing the two men left
behind with the cattle by some well-directed shots.
The yells of baffled rage from the disappointed
Zulus were answered by a ringing cheer of triumph
from the little party as they rode up the steep which
led to the column. The enemy, however, still continued
to appear at various points along the sides
of the hills, and in some places appeared to be
dropping like monkeys from crag to crag, and it
was easy to see that had not these scouts been
mounted they would have been greatly at a disadvantage
on such difficult ground. In fact, part
of the line of scouts was in a valley surrounded by
mountains, and from which egress, in case of a
struggle setting in, would be difficult. They, therefore,
hurried to get upon ground more favourable
for cavalry movements. As they did so the rear
sections had twice to turn and drive off the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
who began to come closer to their rear. Facing
about, one of the sergeants charged right at them
with half a dozen men, and silenced their fire on the
right. Several more galloped to the left rear, where
the fire was as close as fifty and sixty yards, and on
this occasion all had some narrow escapes. However,
in about a quarter of an hour they rejoined the
main body, having driven off the Zulus. Their
horses' heads, however, had hardly cleared the
bushes when shriller yells than before arose along
the mountains in front, and they had only commenced
riding into the plain when another sharp
rifle fire began crackling along the ridges of the
Zinguin Neck. As they steadily advanced this firing
ceased, and the scene along the hills, which seemed
to terminate to the west in a stupendous cliff,
became more varied and interesting. Signal fire
after signal fire of grass was lighted, and broad
columns of smoke rolled into the air, and these
being repeated from summit to summit, evidently
showed that their movements were carefully watched.
A party of horsemen was now despatched to scour
the valley on the left front, and all along the woods,
which fringed the sides of the steep hills in front,
jets of smoke marked their downward progress.
As the crackling and flashing approached the bush
where the hills met the plain, individual forms of
Zulus could be seen, and then coming swiftly
towards the main body there broke out from the
dust and smoke a small mob of cattle, quickly followed
by the skirmishers galloping in. Three small
kraals were found to be in flames, fired by the Zulus
as they retired with their cattle before the advance
of the English horsemen. Two mobs of oxen could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
be seen, numbering some hundreds, which were
being hurried away to inaccessible places. The
ground in front of the English force was of a loose
and calcareous nature, and, occupying as it did the
space between mountain and river, was torn and
cut up in every direction by deep white gullies, by
which the Zulus were retiring sheltered from attack.
The ridges between these gullies afforded the enemy
additional shelter, being grown over with scrubby
brush. Half the cavalry were now sent on to secure
the approaches to the river, and guard against any
surprise in that direction, and in a quarter of an
hour, protected by the horsemen in rear, the whole
body had passed over in safety.</p>

<p>The General, with his escort, had during the
morning's march passed two of his old camps on
the Kambula, and about twelve miles further on
came to a piece of elevated rock or hillock, whence
they had a capital view of White Umvolosi valley,
while to the south-west they looked down upon the
Blood river, Conference Hill, and the dark shadow
of the Durnberg range beyond. The Zinguin Neck,
where the White Umvolosi has its source, stretched
away at their feet, and farther behind they looked
upon the southern slopes of Zlobani, rising in ledges
or bastions in the distance. Just underneath the
shoulder of Conference Hill could be seen, in the
bright sunlight, the white tents of Newdigate's
division, and in the opposite direction was a magnificent
view of the precipitous terraced ledges of
the Zlobani, down which our brave fellows had been
driven on the fatal 28th of March. As soon as
they reached the top of the Zinguin they were met
by Buller, whose people were actively engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
harassing a number of Zulus who were keeping up
a desultory and harmless fire from the krantz in
front. The breeze now cleared away the mists
which hung over the valley, and away to the west
could be made out what seemed to be a village
perched upon a terrace half way up the berg. The
face of this terrace presented a wild and singular
appearance. What at a distance had appeared level
and almost unbroken was in reality a sort of amphitheatre
not less than 1000 feet high, crescent shaped,
and with a terrace fortified by low stone walls springing
from rock to rock, and intersected by enormous
fissures or caves connected with each other, and
from which cover a dropping fire was kept up.
Leaving their horses in charge of some few of the
men, some twenty riflemen dashed into these rocks,
where the cover would equally shelter them with
the enemy. From this moment the ringing of shots
was incessant, and it soon became evident that the
Zulus were in force in a favourable position to annoy
the column until they were expelled. The face of
the crescent seemed as if some powerful eruption
had flung from the top of the hill on to its sides
tons of black and jagged rocks and stones, which,
piled in wild confusion and irregularity on top of
each other up the face of the position, presented
innumerable caves and crannies, from which, as well
as from stone walls, jets of smoke and bullets were
continually issuing. The dismounted men, meanwhile,
began to swarm up the right and left hand
ridges, potting away as they advanced, while a few
moved up the centre, firing when necessary and
taking advantage of what cover was afforded.
Several exciting incidents now occurred. As these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sharpshooters gained a better and more commanding
position for their concerted attack, the Zulus,
finding the situation rather too hot, one by one
began to escape, and the moment a dusky form was
seen gliding through the thorns half a dozen rifles
rang out, sometimes succeeded by the crashing
sound of the body of a huge savage rolling from a
high rock to the stones below. It was simply
wonderful to see in what small crevices these big
Zulus had squeezed themselves. Sometimes three
or four would get together in one spot, generally a
small cave almost inaccessible from above or below,
and which could only be approached by working
along the sides, under the fire of dozens of other
caves and loopholes, every one of which seemed
scooped out for the purpose of creating a cross-fire.
As, therefore, to force home an attack on such
positions was not the present object of Lord Chelmsford,
whose purpose and that of General Wood had
already been achieved in the survey they had made,
the further retreat of the savages was not molested,
and the order was given to remount and prepare to
return to camp. As the mounted men extended to
cover the rear of the column they were greeted by
yells from the few Zulus they had not dislodged,
and a few parting shots were sent after them as
they descended the slope.</p>

<p>On the following morning Wood's entire force
paraded at daybreak, tents were struck, waggons
packed, and they bade farewell to Kambula range,
upon which they had been so long encamped in
various positions, and set out for Mayegwhana,
where a fresh camp was pitched. Mayegwhana, or
Queen's Kraal, is as nearly as possible three miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
north of Bemba's Kop, on which some months ago,
and before he went on to Kambula, General Wood
was encamped. In this new camp Wood had with
him the following troops:&mdash;The 13th Light Infantry,
under Major England [their colonel, Gilbert, having
gone into Utrecht on a few days' well-earned sick-leave.
Of this fine corps Captains Cox and Persse,
both rather badly wounded at Kambula, were rapidly
progressing towards convalescence. Poor Leet, the
other major, still suffered from his crushed foot,
which was caused as far back as February, but which
accident did not prevent his saving a comrade during
Zlobani's fatal day, and for which General Wood
recommended him for the honour of a Victoria
Cross]; the 90th Light Infantry, under their own
commanding officer, Colonel Cherry; the two corps
making up a compact and admirably homogeneous
brigade of 1200. One thousand men of Buller's and
Russell's Horse, now in better condition than ever,
and excellently mounted, with a body of Royal
Engineers and Major Tremlett's battery of mounted
guns; a total of 2000 Europeans, and about 1200
Native Contingent, or in all about 3200 men. With
this force, and supported actively from its base, there
could be no difficulty or danger in pushing on, and
it was no secret that the inactivity they were forced
to endure did not lie at General Wood's door, for he
on more than one occasion suggested substitutes for
waggon transport&mdash;the cause of the prevailing inaction.
Drivers and foreloopers were what could not
be obtained. One of such is required for each span
of oxen, the driver, who stands on the front seat of
the waggon and wields an enormously long whip,
and the <i>voorloper</i>, who leads in front. Ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the day of Isandhlwana, and on account of the panic
which prevailed from that date, due to the massacre
of the natives then employed, it was found impossible
to obtain their services in adequate numbers;
and even of those still in employ numbers were continually
deserting, for the purpose of returning to
their respective homes within the border. Meanwhile
Wood was not idle, but, day by day, was
making the best use of the scanty material at his
disposal. The few drivers and foreloopers he had
been able to retain were sent for and paraded before
the General, who briefly explained to them that in
future they should be armed, fully organized, receive
regular rates of daily and liberal pay, while their
personal safety should be looked after by the employment
of strong guards and convoys wherever
they had to march. This, it must be allowed, was
much wanted, and gave some grounds for complaint,
as in the earlier stages of the campaign the waggons
on too many occasions were not only allowed to
straggle, but were left to shift for themselves. Behind
General Wood's new camp, about ten miles off,
and at right angles to Bemba's Kop, was Conference
Hill, at which place General Newdigate was concentrating
the bulk of his command. He had with him
at this time the King's Dragoon Guards, the left wing
of the 17th Lancers, part of the 21st Fusiliers and
58th Regiments, with N Battery 6th Brigade Royal
Artillery. Seven miles away from Conference Hill
was Doornkop, and here were the 94th Regiment,
three companies of the 21st, and four of the 80th.
Conference Hill was within a very short time rendered
practically impregnable by works constructed
by the 94th Regiment, who, under Colonel Malthus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
encamped at this spot; it also became one of the
chief dep&ocirc;ts for the supplies of Newdigate's division.
This dep&ocirc;t was formed upon a kop, or rising ground,
to the east of the larger hill, and was protected by
three exceedingly well-built forts, constructed <i>en
&eacute;chelon</i>, so as to afford a mutual and most effectively-planned
flanking defence. The largest of these
forts was a regularly traced bastion of polygonal
form, with the length of its lines of defence in due
proportion to the range of the weapons likely to be
employed. The exterior sides of this work were
150 yards in length, and the parapet was sufficiently
thick to resist anything but artillery fire. The
flanks were drawn at right angles to the faces, so as
to give a fire which could sweep the ditches and
ground in front of the bastions. A couple of ramps
were cut in the prolongation of the ditch of the face,
whose surface passed through the crests of the flanks
and lines drawn parallel to the bottom of the counterscarp
of the opposite flank, and about two feet
and a half above them. This fort was garrisoned by
the headquarters of the 94th, and the other two, of
somewhat smaller dimensions, by a company each of
the Royal Engineers and the 94th. Considerable
pains were expended in the construction of these
works, which did the Engineers and the 94th the
greatest credit for the workmanlike line and scientific
character of their tracing and position. The plan
of these works somewhat resembled that adopted by
General Newdigate at Landsman's Drift. The cattle
laager was composed of waggons formed into square,
while at each salient angle were small forts&mdash;one of
which had artillery&mdash;and the whole were joined
corner to corner, so that a straight line drawn between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
their extreme points would pass through the
centre of each square. By this means a perfect
flanking defence was obtained, as each fort commanded
two faces of the laager. Meanwhile the First
Division had been by no means idle, in spite of their
difficulties as to transport and the attacks of camp
fever, which had been so much more frequent with
them than with No. 2 column. From their base at
Fort Tenedos a convoy was started every eight days
to Fort Chelmsford, on the Inyezani, and its regular
departure did much to expedite the forward movement
of that force. On the 5th May, however, a
somewhat more exciting episode took place. A
convoy of the usual description was paraded on that
day for the conveyance of stores and ammunition to
the Inyezani. Fifty waggons, not too heavily laden,
with 3000 barrels on each, were detailed under the
protection of a convoy, composed of C Troop of
Lonsdale's Horse, commanded by Captain Hampden
Whalley. From the foot of the fort whence the
convoy started stretches a sandy plain, dotted with
trees, and containing about 3000 acres. This, as it
gets narrowed into a gorge between the river and the
mountains, becomes broken, being intruded upon in
every direction by foot-hills and watercourses. The
fort cattle were grazing upon this plain under the
charge of some of De Burgh's horsemen, when, as
the convoy was passing across the first drift over
the river, about two miles from the fort, but out of
sight of the sentries, suddenly there sprang out from
gully and kloof hundreds of swarthy warriors, who set
to work, some shouting and firing, to try and drive the
cattle away through the pass, whilst others, by far
the larger portion, made a combined onslaught upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the leading and rear waggons of the train. The
convoy had, therefore, a double duty to perform&mdash;to
assist De Burgh's men in recovering the grazing
cattle, and also to beat off the Zulus who were
attacking the waggons. Their object was to intercept
the cattle now being run off at a rapid pace,
and to secure the waggons in front and rear, which
had been partly surrounded by the enemy. Whalley
at once despatched a messenger to the fort for assistance,
and remaining himself, as in duty bound, to
repulse the waggon attack, detached about twenty of
his best men, under his subaltern, to overtake and
bring back the absconding oxen. The waggons were
soon out of danger; for the men dashed at the Zulus
in such a determined manner that the attacking party,
not very numerous, soon bolted into the bush, but
the other portion of the skirmishes deserves description.
After a gallop of a mile the leading troopers
in pursuit came up with the enemy and the cattle,
which were now all in confusion and involved in the
broken waterworn hills at the foot of the pass, and,
on looking back, they were astonished and considerably
mortified to find that they did not appear
to be followed by the rest of their party! Undauntedly,
however, the sergeant in command pushed
on, firing steadily and with fatal effect from the
saddle, and, with his gaze fixed firmly upon the leading
cattle, worked his way through the frightened
oxen to the front. He was well and gallantly followed
by half a dozen men, who had managed to
keep up with him in his rapid ride in pursuit, and
these fine fellows, nothing daunted by the numbers
of the enemy, kept potting away at every Zulu that
showed his head from behind the rocks, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
most of them had now retreated. Suddenly the low
banks of the ravine, up which they were now rushing,
swarmed on both sides with the enemy, and it
was evident that the driving of cattle into this position
was one of the usual Zulu artifices by which
they were so often successful. The Zulus kept up
a feeble and ill-directed fire from the crevices of
rock where they had taken cover, and all this time
the troopers were employed in heading and turning
back the cattle, a task which would have been far
beyond their best energies had not an episode occurred
which materially changed the aspect of affairs.
Alone, in the midst of a score of enemies, the sergeant
fought steadily on, loading, firing, advancing,
and driving back the cattle as if he bore a charmed
life. The Zulus seemed paralyzed, and shunned his
vicinity, for when he trotted to where a shield or
assegai was seen, it immediately disappeared. He
had, however, great need of help, for he had come to
his last cartridge; but at that moment he felt a
chance of life, as he heard the welcome shout of an
English cheer, and, looking in the direction whence the
sound seemed to come, he saw rapidly descending the
steep krantz above the remaining horsemen of his
party, who had chosen another and easier path up
the ravine, which enabled them to take the Zulus in
flank. The affair was now over; and although no
prisoners were taken, the blood-stains on the rocks
and boulders around proved that there must have
been many wounded. The cattle were all recovered,
and Whalley's convoy reached its destination without
further molestation.</p>

<p>Great changes for the better had also been made
in the distribution of the First Division. The 88th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had been shifted from their former position on the
extreme left front of Fort Tenedos to the commanding
hill in its immediate front. In like manner
they had been advanced <i>en &eacute;chelon</i> to the extreme
left front, and the Buffs had been moved in laager
to the right rear of the 88th; while Lonsdale's
Horse held the hill formerly occupied by the 99th.
The Naval Brigade were in camp behind the
fort, with Cook's Horse posted in their immediate
vicinity, and the Mounted Infantry upon a hill
immediately below Lonsdale's Horse, and a portion
of the Artillery were on the old ground of the
Engineers, with the Native Contingent in their
front. The forts also belonging to this division on
the Tugela, Inyezani, and at Ginghilovo were by
this time completed, and admirably manned. To
guard against any surprise pickets were posted in
advance and on the flanks of these works, to watch
every line of approach, and especially those where
the country afforded cover and concealment. Sentries
were placed at the salients of all entrenched works,
and double sentries at the entrances, while whenever
a drawbridge had been made it was carefully
drawn up at sunset. Occasional patrols during the
day, and frequent patrols during the night and in
thick weather were not relaxed, and the result was
that the Zulus, seeing such activity, scarcely ever
molested the working parties. In the ditches of
the four coast-line forts were placed at intervals
quantities of dry straw and brushwood, with oil
and tar poured on in profusion, to fire in case of
attack, and trustworthy soldiers were told off to
fire these on the approach of the enemy. Sandbag
loopholes were constructed on the tops of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
parapet, while large beams, supported at intervals
by sods of earth, were used for the same purpose.
Fire-shells were placed in readiness to be rolled
into the ditch. The distances from each parapet
of all conspicuous objects was carefully measured
and communicated to the garrison, and rods with
whitewashed tops, so as to be visible at night, were
erected, to mark the various ranges.</p>

<p>Port Durnford also had been reported practicable,
and a fort and dep&ocirc;t was being established there.</p>

<p>It was now the end of the third week in May, and
all was ready for an advance, with the exception of
the dearth of transport beasts and vehicles. It will
be well, therefore, to briefly recapitulate the military
situation. Crealock, now at Fort Chelmsford, was
to connect himself with Port Durnford, and then to
move along the coast with 10,000 men, supported
and supplied by the Naval Brigade from Port Durnford.
This was called No. 1, or the First Column.
The second division in the north under Lord
Chelmsford, his immediate subordinates being
Generals Wood, Newdigate, and Marshall, was to
move from Dundee, their advanced posts being
already Doornkop, Landsman's Drift, Ladismith,
Conference Hill, and Mayegwhana. General Newdigate
was now at Dundee, and had with him the
King's Dragoon Guards, under Colonel Alexander;
the left wing of the 17th Lancers, under Major
Boulderson; the headquarters 21st Fusiliers, the
58th Regiment, with N battery, 6th Brigade, Royal
Artillery. At Doornkop, about seven miles from
Dundee, were three companies of the 21st, and four
companies of the 80th. Wood occupied the most
advanced point at the front, at a place called Mayegwhana,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
or the Wolf's Kraal, and had with him the
13th and 90th Light Infantry, 1000 of Buller's and
Russell's Horse, a strong native contingent, and a
battery of six 7-pounder mountain guns. Again
at Conference Hill were a company of Royal Engineers
and the 94th Regiment, under their commanding
officer Colonel Malthus. In addition to
Colonel Malthus's regulars there were at Conference
Hill about 150 Basutos, some volunteers, and a few
Natal natives, all under Captain Birkett. Dundee
and Conference Hill were the two most important
bases of General Newdigate, and convoys of supplies
were daily arriving at each. At Landsman's Drift
there were three strong forts, with an intervening
space for cattle. These had been designed by
General Newdigate himself, and were constructed
<i>en &eacute;chelon</i>. They were occupied by the 21st, 58th,
and five companies of the 2nd battalion Natal
Native Contingent. These three entrenched field-works
were admirably constructed, so as to afford
each other mutual defence. In tracing these works
great care had been taken that the angles should be
directed upon inaccessible ground, such as a krantz,
a marsh, or a pond. None of the faces were
exposed to enfilade, and the longest were so traced
that they looked towards the ground over which an
enemy would most likely advance, and which could
be swept by the fire of the garrisons. These
works were all somewhat in the shape of demi-bastions,
and were constructed on a square or
polygon, whose exterior sides were about 150 yards.
The parapets were only breast high, but unusually
thick, and, allowing for the penetration of rifle-fire
at ten yards being twenty-one inches, the parapets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
had been constructed six feet, having a base 3&middot;1,
while the interior slopes are maintained by strong
rev&ecirc;tements. Works of this character have certain
advantages, which are, that they require less length
of parapet than a bastioned fort; although, on the
other hand, there are these disadvantages, namely,
that there is on each side one dead re-entering
angle, i.e., an angle perfectly screened from fire,
and that the ditches are not so perfectly defended
as they should be. Each of the battalions above
named built one of these demi-bastioned forts,
and the tents of the respective corps were pitched
outside two of the faces, with advanced pickets
thrown out well to the front. In the interval
between the right rear angle of the most advanced
fort and the left front of the second demi-bastion
was the cattle laager&mdash;a most important matter in
Cape warfare. This arrangement enabled the fire
from the first fort to rake the ground in its front
and left faces, while the fire from the supporting
work could do the same duty for the rear and right
faces. From this description it will be understood
that the works spoken of effectually covered the
cattle laager, as well as afforded perfect cover for
their garrisons. These three entrenched positions
at Landsman's Drift were the delight and the pride
of the regiments who built them; for although the
Royal Engineers had been employed in general
superintendence, it was well known that the actual
designs were made by General Newdigate, and the
labour carried out by the 21st and 58th.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the garrisoning of the posts
in the rear of the advance were as follows:&mdash;Forts
Pearson and Tenedos had each assigned to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
two companies, while a reserve upon which they
could draw was placed at Stanger. Upon the Lower
Drift, down as far as Kranz Kop, the river was to be
guarded by 2000 of the border natives, under
Captain Lucas, supported by 130 Natal Volunteers
stationed at Thring's Post. Thirteen hundred men
of the Native Contingent garrisoned Fort Cherry,
in rear of the abandoned post which formerly
covered the ferry drift, while the border for seven
miles was watched by 2000 natives, under the
superintendence of Mr. Wheelwright, at Hermanberg.
Greytown was held by a garrison of two
companies. Three thousand natives lined the
Umzinga border, and Helpmakaar was held by
the Natal police and Carabineers. The defence
of the new entrenchment at Rorke's Drift, now
called Fort Melville, was entrusted to three companies
of the 2-24th, which regiment was anything
but pleased at the preference which had been given
to the first battalion, newly arrived from England,
by allowing it to participate in the active operations,
while the second battalion was detained in the rear.
There were to be four other companies of the 2-24th,
and of these one was to hold Landsman's Drift, while
two were to be left at Conference Hill. At Balte
Spruit two companies, and at Burgher's Laager,
Utrecht, and Luneberg each one company, formed
the respective garrisons. It will be observed, therefore,
that the line of the Tugela was but thinly
defended, but, on the other hand, there was a strong
chain of posts on the advance along the coast. The
force at this period in the Lower Tugela command
may be summarized as follows:&mdash;The 2-3rd Foot,
the 57th, the 3-60th Rifles, the 88th, the 91st, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
99th, or six battalions of infantry, mustering some
5400 bayonets, with M battery 6th Brigade, O
battery 6th Brigade, 8th battery 7th Brigade, and
the 30th company Royal Engineers. To these may
be added the Naval Contingent, and with the
native force the total amounted to quite 10,000
men.</p>

<p>But before the general advance was commenced
there remained one sad duty to be performed&mdash;the
burial of those who were still lying on the fatal field
of Isandhlwana. It will be asked why this had not
been done long since? The answer is simple: want
of cavalry, want of transport, and want of opportunity.
Since the day upon which the fatal surprise
took place, there had rarely been an hour to spare
from the trying ordeal of official duty, while the
task of providing for the living and feeding the daily
reinforcements had left no time to attend to the
dead. The moment, however, Marshall's troopers
were upon the frontier, it was felt that something
could be done, and every measure and precaution
were taken to bring about a satisfactory result. To
avoid any chance of a mishap or failure, Lord
Chelmsford personally consulted General Wood
when at Kambula, and subsequently at Utrecht,
and it was decided that, previous to any formidable
cavalry patrol being undertaken in force, a
series of short reconnaissances should be carried
out by the indefatigable Buller and his ubiquitous
horsemen. The purpose of this plan was twofold.
In the first place, these perpetual scoutings so
harassed the natives, that the majority, and certainly
the wealthier majority, heartily wished the
war was over; secondly, it was of great importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to learn the whereabouts of the two impis which it
was well known had been for months waiting for
the return of English troops to Isandhlwana, and
this information was effectually obtained by Buller's
zeal and activity. The first and most important
reconnaissance was made by General Wood in person,
who ordered a night-parade of a selected body
of horsemen on the 9th May. The force on this
occasion consisted of sixty Frontier Light Horse,
under Captain D'Arcy; thirty Mounted Infantry,
under Captain Brown; and forty Natal Native
Infantry, under Captain Woodgate, 4th Regiment,
General Wood's staff officer. Their road at first
was an easy descent into the fertile plain that
was spread out like a map at their feet; it then
wound up in a somewhat zigzag manner by the
sides of a steep hill, flanked on the one side by
a ravine, and on the other by a dense bush.
Presently a black body was seen by the advanced
scouts, whom Buller always sent out as "feelers,"
creeping through the bushes on the left, and in our
rear came a second. No shot, however, was fired,
but a Zulu perched high above, and sheltered
in the bush, hails the passing troops in a jeering
manner, and asks them to come and see his kraal.
Orders had been given to the soldiers not to fire
unless fired upon, and this act of forbearance seemed
to wondrously puzzle the native followers, who
were with difficulty prevented from "potting" the
interlocutor. They had made about ten miles, when
the sun began to shine over the edge of the horizon
in all the splendour of an African morning. The
dew had fallen heavily during the night, and consequently
the first rays of the sun produced a mist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
which hung like steam over the valleys. This, however,
soon cleared away and left the atmosphere
clear and transparent, so that the far-off ranges
seemed within a short distance of the column,
whereas they were distant at least thirty or forty
miles. This clearness of course was now a great
advantage and aid to the English party, as it enabled
the scouts to observe far ahead, and rendered surprise
less possible than if the mist and fog had prevailed.
Pushing on now at a canter, they soon came
to a trek, which led them between two tall hills
called Nkandi and Mhundla. Here in the kloof
were two deep spruits or streams, which, however,
were avoided by hugging the sides of Mount
Mhundla, and it was noticed that waggons could be
dragged without any considerable difficulty along
this path. The sun was now well above the horizon,
and General Wood decided to halt, off-saddle, and
let the men have their breakfasts. The place
selected for the "off-saddle" was a slightly wooded
ravine, amidst the rocks of which ran a clear stream
over a grassy and pebbly bed, while behind was a
range of rocky hills, the summit of which was
crowned by huge masses of rock, looking from the
distance like vast Titanic slabs placed by giant
strength in their present position. Before was an
undulating plain, bounded on the right by a river,
and on the far left by a dense bush.</p>

<p>After one hour's rest the order was given to
mount, and away they went, men and horses
thoroughly refreshed and eager for the road. The
bush was gradually getting thicker, and the road
wound by a deep descent into a thickly-wooded
valley. Every one of the party instinctively felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that Zulus must be near, and bracing up the body
and nerves each man prepared for attack. The
leader, too, thought the place suspicious, and made
his dispositions accordingly. Two bodies of horsemen,
each a dozen strong, were sent out to make
a wide d&eacute;tour on either flank, while flankers were
also sent out on either side of the column. The
mounted men who formed the advanced guard closed
to their centre, while those who had been extended
in skirmishing order in the rear had orders to close
up to the column when the defile was approached,
ready to dismount, should it be found impracticable
for horses. It is pretty well known that the most
frequent point of attack in Zulu warfare is the rear
of an enemy's column, particularly when the attack
can be made in a defile. The head of the column
is often allowed to pass unmolested by the Zulu
general, who waits patiently until the main body
has gone by, and then commences a furious onslaught
upon the rear, which will perhaps be followed up
for miles. So these precautions were not superfluous.
Where the column now was could be seen
the traces of burnt kraals and partly destroyed
mealie gardens, showing unmistakably that a skirmish
had taken place not long ago, and Colonel
Buller at once recognized the locality as the spot
where, some ten days before, his scouts had had a
skirmish with Zulus, on the occasion when an impi
was reported as being in the neighbourhood of Balte
Spruit. The anticipations of attack were soon
verified, as a couple of shots rang out from the
right wall of the defile, and this was at once followed
by a tremendous shout coming from the rear. The
leading files of the little party had meanwhile reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the mouth of the gorge without any casualty, and
General Wood and his escort on hearing the firing
at once galloped back to the rear, from whence it
came, and saw in a moment that Zulus were
swarming on the sides of the cliff as if to attack
in rear. The bugle at once sounded the halt, and
the word was suddenly given for twenty men to
wheel about and charge back in full force upon the
unsuspecting foe, who imagined no doubt that he
was going to be allowed all the fun of peppering
the rear without receiving any punishment in
return. With a hearty English shout these fellows,
led by Buller, went straight at the enemy, and
bursting over rough ground and through the high
and tall grass drove the flying Zulus in panic
before them. Buller's appearance at this moment
combined an element of the heroic and the terrible
with a strong infusion of the ludicrous and burlesque.
Leading his men on at a swinging canter,
with his reins in his teeth, a revolver in one hand
and a knobkerrie he had snatched from a Zulu in
the other, his hat blown off in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, and a
large streak of blood across his face, caused by a
splinter of rock from above, this gallant horseman
seemed a demon incarnate to the flying savages,
who slunk out of his path as if he had been&mdash;as
indeed they believed him&mdash;an evil spirit, whose
very look was death. The tables were now completely
turned; the whole of the column is safely
through the poort; one or two Zulus are seen
limping away, assisted into the bush by their comrades,
while the rest stand not upon the order of
their going, but rush pell-mell to gain the shelter of
the neighbouring caves. One large Zulu is seen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
be badly hit, yet he manages to crawl away out of
sight, and doubtless is assisted to escape by his
fellows.</p>

<p>The fun is becoming fast and furious. Buller's
men are in their glory. They have dashed into
the kloof, and are driving the Zulus out of it in
parties of six or eight at a time. Everybody who
an hour ago was as silent and sombre as the
grave thinks it now necessary to yell with excitement.
The sun is now at the meridian, and the day
fearfully hot. The pursuit has been carried through
valley and over ridge; by kloof and through <i>bosch</i>,
by <i>bron</i> (spring) and <i>drift</i> (ford), and the whole
column is scattered in every direction. It is, in
fact, a regular scramble, and all ranks and uniforms
are mixed up together. But the chase begins to
slacken; the pace is too good to last. The recall
sounds, and the firing dies away to a few desultory
shots, while the troopers canter back, dishevelled
and puffing like school-boys after a hard-won goal at
football. As soon as the skirmish was over, and the
column clear of the kloof, the journey was continued,
and they soon reached the southern termination of the
high valley two or three miles farther on, where the
mountains and table-land descend to the more level
and open country beyond, and by a slope which was
noted as too steep for waggons. The General was
the first to set the example of dismounting and
leading his horse straight down most of the way,
while the main body of the little column diverged to
the crest of the hill to the west, where the trek
wound gradually away in a spiral manner to the
plain. This path offered no obstacle whatever to
the transit of waggons, and, moreover, avoided a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
deep donga which lies right across the straight
course. Here General Wood, having an engagement
in camp, left Buller and his men with his
orderly officers and escort, while they continued
their investigations in a direction almost due south,
over a series of rolling plains upon the table-land.
The mist now most unfortunately came on again just
as they had prepared their glasses for a good inspection
of Ibabanango and the Alarm hill, but they
could distinctly see on the right the high ground
before the Khandi and Iheensi hills, and thence
onwards to the Ingutu mountain, where they were
not surprised to see that a signal-fire of considerable
magnitude had been made by the Zulus as soon as
they had fairly been discerned in the open and on
lower ground. About five o'clock they reached the
banks of the Unyunyebea river, one of the tributaries
of the Ityotyosi, which in its turn flows eastward
into the White Umvolosi. Here, as the locality
seemed favourable, they off-saddled, and the men
cooked their dinners, or rather evening meal.
Captain Woodgate, with a Zulu who had returned
lately from Ulundi, and half-a-dozen mounted natives
as escort, rode away to a kop some three miles on,
to reconnoitre. A few Zulus were seen on the
opposite ridge, evidently watching the party's movements;
and as they reached the top of the eminence,
a messenger was despatched by them across the
valley at speed to the next mountain, where soon
after smoke was seen, showing evidently that their
advent had been signalled to the next post. The
remaining Zulus incontinently disappeared up some
rocky ground to the left, and although one of them
was chased by four Natal natives, he as well as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
comrades escaped without injury. Colonel Buller
and Captain Woodgate, not having been able to see
anything of the range of mountains for which they
were looking, went back to explore the river, but
they had scarcely disappeared down the slope when
the mist cleared off, and there could be distinctly
seen the clearly defined outlines of a high isolated
mountain towards the south-east, and this Zulu
scouts declared to be Ibabanango, the principal
object of their search. A number of deserted kraals
belonging to Malafchey and his tribe were close at
hand, and it was found that there was plenty of
mealies and firewood, and a very comfortable meal
was obtained for men and horses. As soon as it was
sufficiently dark to hide his movements, Colonel
Buller, who always adopted the plan of never
bivouacking where he had halted during the day,
quietly shifted the column across the stream to a
spot where a deep donga, sheltered on all sides but
one, gave protection from any night-surprise. The
Natal native cavalry did not bivouac with the remainder
of the patrol, but were allowed to post
themselves and lie down without off-saddling at a
point indicated to their commander, Captain Cochrane,
by Colonel Buller. Sentries were posted,
patrols sent out, and the night passed without incident
or alarm. The next morning, soon after daybreak,
they were again in motion, and were far more
successful in their observations. Colonel Buller,
assisted by Captain Woodgate, obtained excellent
data referring to the position of the two mountains.
From the observations and sketches they were
enabled to make, they came to the conclusion that
there would be no difficulty in the transport of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
waggons on either side of the road as far as Ibabanango,
or in their getting on to the Rorke's Drift
road to Ulundi. Another, and not the least important,
point was noted, namely, that although the
district they surveyed was not nearly so well watered
as the Kambula country, the grass improved and
became of a better quality the more one went into
Zululand. It was so thick, and at the same time so
green, that it would be practically impossible to get
it to burn for at least another month, so that up to
the end of June oxen would be tolerably sure of
grazing. After carefully reconnoitring for some
distance further, without being at all molested,
although a few Zulu scouts were seen here and
there, the column returned to camp, which they
reached about 7.40 p.m., after a most exciting ride
of some fifty miles and two days' experience of Zulu
skirmishing.</p>

<p>Another reconnaissance was organized for the
12th instant. Colonel Buller's patrol on this occasion
was composed exclusively of picked and seasoned
men, and consisted of 60 of the Frontier Light
Horse, under Captain D'Arcy and Lieutenant Blaine;
40 Basutos, under Captain Cockerell and Lieutenants
Henderson and Rane; and 80 of Baker's Horse,
together with a few mounted scouts and orderlies,
making altogether a well-mounted, well-armed, and
well-trained band of 200 horsemen. Colonel Buller's
guests, on this occasion, included the Prince Imperial,
whom he was to meet at Conference Hill,
Mr. Drummond, several officers from headquarters,
and Lord William Beresford, who had earned the
soubriquet of "The Ubiquitous." Having received
full instructions, and been supplied with the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
three days' rations, with the best wishes for luck from
their comrades, and a cheer from the men and officers,
they filed out of the camp in the highest of spirits
and eager for the road. Their first halt was to be
Conference Hill, where the Prince Imperial was to join
them. This post was at that time the most advanced
point of General Newdigate's division, and from
Doornkop the distance is about fifteen miles. From
Wood's camp at Wolf's Kraal the distance would be
about seven miles, and this was soon accomplished.
They found his Imperial Highness waiting for them,
with Colonel Malthus, commanding the 94th, and
some other officers, showing the Prince round the
defences. After duly inspecting all the defences
shown to them by Colonel Malthus, they made the
best of their way to a spot selected for their bivouac,
about six miles farther on, and where they remained
the night, while their horses grazed contented in
some mealie fields.</p>

<p>Half an hour before dawn on the following morning
Colonel Buller was to be seen scanning the
horizon in all directions, and by sunrise his party
were all in the saddle, and <i>en route</i>. They soon
reached the ford at the Blood river, which had
gone down considerably since Buller had last seen
it. The country over which they rode was fairly
open. They crossed the ford without difficulty,
and gaining the opposite bank, reached a plain, from
which they were, however, divided by a broad and
well-worn watercourse. Here they faced the mountain,
a long unbroken range, varying in height from
1000 to 1500 feet, which ran down the left of the
valley. A portion of the mounted men were now
sent away to the right, with instructions to ride up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the kloof, then dismount, scale the rocks, and await
the result of the advance of the main body. Should
natives oppose the latter in force, the flanking party
were then to drive them down the mountain, where
it was expected they would fall into the hands of
the Basutos under Henderson and Rane, who were
placed in ambush on the left. After half an hour's
careful scouting, not a sign of a Zulu could be seen,
and Colonel Buller then gave the not unwelcome
order to off-saddle at, or rather close to, a kraal
which bore unmistakable evidences of recent native
occupation. The troopers had no sooner off-saddled,
however, than the wily savages emerged from the
caves and crevices where they had been hid, and
could be distinctly seen making the best of their
way with considerable speed up Sirayo's krantz
exactly opposite to where Buller's men were. They
evidently were in some force, and two or three men
on horseback were observed directing their movements
as their reinforcements came rapidly in. The
force, however, they were able to collect was
extremely small, and certainly would not have
numbered more than half Colonel Buller's command.
The Prince Imperial was excellently mounted upon
a handsome and powerful horse, who seemed, however
a little fidgety under fire. Lieut. Rane was
now sent on with a few Basutos, to see whether any
stand would be made by the enemy; and the Prince
Imperial immediately galloped after him, to see what
he could of the fun. When these men arrived at
the foot of the mountain, they found a much easier
ascent than they had expected. A footpath, which,
however, was quite practicable for horses, was seen
winding in a devious manner in and out of the tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
mimosa-trees which fringed the belt of the wood,
and along this path dashed Rane and his Basutos,
closely followed by the Prince, whose impatience to
get to the front was noticed by all. On reaching
the summit, however, not a Zulu or an enemy of
any kind was to be seen. This was soon accounted
for by the fact that half way up the krantz on the
right were posted a number of Zulus&mdash;perhaps
about 100. While the main body were watching
these people, to see if they would attempt to cut off
from the column the Prince and the Basutos, who
were surrounding the plateau above, about 100
savages now suddenly showed themselves, as if to
invite combat, on the opposite side of the ravine.
The object of all these man&#339;uvres was now obvious
enough. The Zulus who were running away on the
plateau above were so doing to lure the English
force on to follow, when the party halfway up the
krantz would probably be joined by a number of
men from the kraals, and endeavour to block them
in from the rear. It was now noticed that they
were about to send messengers away for assistance,
and this they could not do without running the
gauntlet of fire of Buller's column. Crouching
down, so as to be concealed as much as possible
from the fire of the English rifles, two of the men
belonging to the Zulu party ran rapidly away from
the native column until they were within fifty yards
of Buller's position. As they passed, a man raised
his gun, and made an excellent shot at the leader,
who never moved after he touched the ground,
upon which he fell headlong. The remaining man,
seeing the fate of his comrade, ran back to his people
with wonderful activity, sharpened no doubt by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
ping and whiz of half a dozen rifle-bullets sent after
him at about 200 yards. Baker's Horse were now
sent on to the table-land above, to look after the
Prince Imperial, Rane, and the Basutos, whom they
found in high glee, chasing some flying Zulus, who
seemed too scared to notice that their assailants
only numbered eight men.</p>

<p>They now surveyed the surrounding country without
further molestation. In front lay a broad valley,
in the midst of which ran the Blood river, now
shrunk to a thin silver thread; on the left at some
distance off could be seen the table-shaped mountain
of Mhlatze; and on the right was that spot of fatal
memories, Isandhlwana, with its huge crag in the
rear, raising its lion-like crest over the veldt below.
After descending the mountain and burning the
kraals on its south-east slopes, Buller and his party
returned to camp without any event happening on
their homeward route.</p>

<p>It was now determined at headquarters that a
reconnaissance in force should be made under the
command of General Marshall, for the double purpose
of still further pursuing the investigations
begun and of burying the dead at Isandhlwana.
For this purpose a force of no less than 2490 men
was detailed, and consisted of the 17th Lancers, the
King's Dragoon Guards, four companies of the
second battalion 24th, and a number of native
auxiliaries. Major Black's experience and knowledge
of the road were found of great use, and the
two cavalry regiments were capitally handled by
Colonels Drury-Lowe and Alexander. Major Bengough
had charge of the native battalion. The
Natal mounted police were under Major Dartnell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and one hundred and fifty Army Service horses were
led, in order to bring back the waggons. The
entire force was gathered together at Rorke's Drift
one hour before daylight, and carefully inspected by
the light of the camp lanterns. They marched
down to the river at daylight, and commenced to
ford the stream, which was finally crossed by six
o'clock. Colonel Drury-Lowe commanded the First
Brigade, consisting of two squadrons of his own
corps and two of the King's, and made a d&eacute;tour
round the head and crest of the Bashee valley
behind Sirayo's celebrated mountain, and, without
any mishap or molestation, effected a junction with
the remainder of the column at Isandhlwana.
Colonel Alexander, with a brigade similarly constituted,
marched by the direct waggon road straight
upon his objective, while he threw out strong
flanking parties right and left as he advanced. A
squadron was sent at Colonel Black's suggestion to
hold the gorge of the Bashee on the right, and a
number of vedettes were occupied in patrolling the
left of the same valley. Bengough's natives, meanwhile,
came on at a rapid pace, and were thrown
out into skirmishing order along the slopes of the
Ingutu range, where the English troops once had
such a tussle with Sirayo and his men. In fact,
here, it may be said, the first blood in the campaign
was shed, when they destroyed this cruel chief's
stronghold.</p>

<p>The manner in which Bengough's well-trained
men scoured and scouted was most gratifying to
observe. Every nook and corner, every crevice
and cave, were carefully explored, and as the
men advanced slowly along the valley and slopes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the mountain, every kraal was fired that came in
their way. These men gradually worked their way
round until they came along the range to the
eastern limit of the valley, where the hunting-path
trends towards the great kraal of Cetywayo. Meanwhile
the cavalry were not idle. Crowds of vedettes
swarmed along the sides of the valley ready to
outflank any enemy or take him in reverse should
he appear. While this was undertaken, the main
force moved steadily along the front of the valley,
and over the brow of the opposite ridge Bengough's
men swarmed, chanting their war-song in native
fashion. Down the hillside, to hold the head of the
valley, came the four companies of the 24th, marching
steadily in column of fours. The sun streamed
in splendour upon the glittering files of cavalry as
they wound like a brilliant chain along the greensward.
Nothing could exceed the picturesque <i>ensemble</i>
that greeted the eye on all sides; nothing
could be sadder than the mission upon which they
came.</p>

<p>As soon as the entire force was concentrated
on the neck, their solemn but ghastly duty commenced.
Rider and horse, officer and private, boy
and man, their grim and parchment-looking skins
half eaten by the carrion birds and half covering
the bleaching bones, gave to the scene a terrible and
weird significance, which can never be forgotten.
Many of the bodies were easily recognized. Captain
Shepstone at once pointed out that of Colonel
Durnford, which was interred with deep respect in
a donga near the spot where he fell. Forty-five
waggons were brought away by the horses and
mules, and a quantity of stores still intact was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
carried in them. The staff of the 24th's colours
was also recovered; and the troops, having fully
carried out their sad <i>devoir</i> in the most effective
manner, returned home with the same precaution
with which they had moved on to the field.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="bq1">Advance of the 2nd column&mdash;Landsman's Drift to Kopje Allein&mdash;Description
of camp&mdash;Plan of campaign&mdash;Discovery of Port
Durnford&mdash;It becomes the base of 1st division&mdash;Troops composing
1st column&mdash;Crealock's journey to Durnford.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> force thus gathered at Landsman's Drift was
now quite ready for an immediate advance. It was
therefore determined to push on this column (2nd)
at once. Accordingly, on the 27th May the troops
were formed up in line of contiguous quarter-columns
by eight a.m., and after the General and his staff
had ridden down the ranks, making a minute and
detailed inspection, the various columns moved off
by fours in succession from the right precisely at
nine a.m. Newdigate's Division, which led the way,
consisted of the 21st Fusiliers, the 94th Foot, the
58th Foot, and the 2nd battalion 24th Regiment,
together with a wing of the King's Dragoon Guards,
a wing of the 17th Lancers, a battalion of Native
Contingent, two batteries of Royal Artillery, and a
company of Engineers. The crossing of the Buffalo
at Landsman's Drift was commenced at half-past
nine, and the rear had crossed by two o'clock. The
exact distance to Kopje Allein as the crow flies is
said to be ten miles, but the route taken was somewhat
circuitous, so as, for the sake of the waggons,
to avoid many bad places, swamps, morasses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
mud-holes, which abound in this part of the country.
The country between the Blood river and the
Buffalo is tolerably well supplied with water, comparatively
open, but singularly treeless in its character,
though there were patches here and there
along the road, and the district seemed well adapted
for cattle posts and grazing purposes. Indeed there
could be seen a number of large deserted kraals and
homesteads, which had once evidently been the
dep&ocirc;ts of pastoral wealth and prosperity. These
sites of industry had suffered a hard and rough
usage in the terrible necessities of war. These
depredations were largely caused by the foraging
parties in search of fuel, the great want in all our
camps. Supplies, indeed, on more than one occasion,
were brought even as far as from the northern
slopes of the Durnberg, a distance of twenty miles.
Most of the best information in regard to the topographical
features of this portion of the campaign
was furnished by the very excellent reports drawn
up by Colonel Buller, Lord William Beresford, and,
above all, the Prince Imperial, whose pen and pencil
gave a vivid and life-like idea of the physical characteristics
of this line of advance.</p>

<p>On the 16th instant Colonel Buller's second patrol
returned at noon to General Wood's camp at the
Wolf's kraal, and had been so successful in its
reconnoitring operations that its officers were able to
report that no large bodies of Zulus were within
twenty miles of the Blood river, or, indeed, anywhere
between the White Umvolosi and the Buffalo
river. The same evening on which the patrol
started it bivouacked at Kopje Allein, and, indeed, it
was owing to the excellent reports made by Buller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and his staff that the place was chosen as one of the
links in the line of advance. A few Zulus there
were, it is true, hovering about in the distance, and
attempts were made by feigned attacks and feigned
retreats to lure the troops into ambush, but Buller
was far too old a soldier to be taken in by such
wiles. When the men had got steadily on the summit
of the hill they were exploring, the Zulu skirmishers
disappeared into some of the caves surrounding
Sirayo's old kraal, and nothing but some
huts full of mealies could be found. The patrol that
night slept on the slopes of the Ingutu mountains, and
the following morning scouted in a southerly direction
in rear of the Ingwe range, as far as the White
Umvolosi, showing in a tolerably plain manner that
the country about there was quite denuded of its
population, at least between the Buffalo river and
the White Umvolosi, while to the eastward and the
northward of the latter river there were plenty of
Zulus and cattle, but no large or important bodies
were assembled north of the Isandaka range.</p>

<p>The Prince Imperial had won all hearts during
these three days in the saddle and night bivouac,
and was seen to have considerably improved in
health since his last visit to the camp.</p>

<p>From the notes and sketches made by the officers
above named the following data may be adduced:&mdash;The
key of the road from the Utrecht to the Ulundi
country is undoubtedly the Inhlazatye mountain, and,
although this road runs along a narrow ledge with a
precipice on the one side and with huge boulders on
the other, interspersed with thorns and bush, yet
still it is actually the most direct line of advance
upon Ulundi. This Inhlazatye mountain covers a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
vast extent of country, has an immense quantity of
thorn-bush over it, is very broken and steep, but undoubtedly
can be turned by an invading force from
the north either to the east or to the west, probably
the latter, where little bush worth mentioning would
have to be passed through. The most commanding
and open positions are upon the highlands to the
south of the White Umvolosi and Umtatoosi rivers,
girdling the new capital, Ulundi. These are the
Emtonjaneni hills (which are called Magnibonium on
most maps), near the White Umvolosi, and the Tyoe
and Entumeni heights in rear of the Umtatoosi, all
healthy positions, well watered, and with abundant
grass and wood. From the Emtonjaneni hills, explored
by Colonel Buller, who estimates them at
200 feet high, the circle of royal kraals on the farther
side of the White Umvolosi can be seen; three
roads lead to the rear into the colony, the upper,
central, and lower. The Ekowe, Entumeni, and
Ungoga ranges, from 1500 to 2000 feet above the
sea level, dominate the valley of the Umtatoosi.
Healthy positions suitable for cavalry encampments
may be found on these heights, well wooded and
watered, with excellent grass and roads leading to
the rear into the colony; and here Marshall's cavalry
kept open our communications and effectually severed
connexion between the Zulu's right and left impis.
These central and coast lines, which are joined by a
cross-road, both follow the course of the Umtatoosi.</p>

<p>During the march, and whenever the country
would admit of such formation, the leading corps
halted, and the extended line of march was curtailed
by the succeeding regiment forming upon its left;
waggons came up in a sort of deployment into line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and certain simple movements were practised which
would be carried out in case of sudden attack. Lord
Chelmsford invariably made a great point of concentrating
his waggons whenever the slightest opportunity
offered. General Newdigate and General
Wood between them had 900 waggons, and it may
easily be imagined what a column 450 of these
would make. Allowing 30 yards to each&mdash;and that
is not much, there being 16 or 18 oxen to each
load&mdash;each column of baggage alone is 15 miles
long, but to this distance must be added 5 yards
interval, and this gives 18 miles to defend. Of
course, the forage for the large cavalry force made
one of the greatest strains upon the commissariat,
and all had to be sacrificed to this necessity. This
column and Crealock's were in this respect not upon
a par, as it had to provide for not less than 2000
horses, each receiving 12 lb. of corn daily; which gave
a total of 24,000 lb. daily, or 3000 lb. per waggon
load, or 6 waggons daily to supply them. At this
rate, therefore, it required 120 waggons to carry the
oats for the cavalry alone. All Lord Chelmsford's
and the staff horses were, however, placed upon half
rations.</p>

<p>Ibabanango, which Lord Chelmsford had selected
as an advanced dep&ocirc;t for the united forces of his
column and that of Wood, is again situated about
midway between this place (Kopje Allein) and the
king's kraal at Ulundi. The troops in this camp
consisted of a company of Engineers, the cavalry
brigade, two batteries of Royal Artillery, four line
battalions, and 800 natives. The encampment was
rather extensive, but this upon sanitary grounds
and the best medical advice. The battalions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
encamped as at open order, front as in line, with a
depth of 116 yards, which is unusual, for half the
above frontage is the usual encampment, and 30
yards were left between each of the four battalions.
Each regiment of cavalry usually occupies 172 yards
of front and 130 yards of depth, but its camp can
be condensed to 120 yards of front by crossing heel-ropes,
and this, for defensive reasons, was the plan
adopted by General Marshall. This could not be
done with Cape or Indian remounts, as entire horses
would fight if so close to each other; but English
horses are so accustomed to this proximity that it
was found they throve better when allowed companionship.
To each battery of artillery was
allowed a frontage of 133 yards, with a depth of
114 yards, or 70 yards front at close order, while
from centre to centre of the tents 10 paces were
allotted. The kitchens were simple enough, being
nothing more than a trench to catch the wind and
hold the usual pattern of Flanders or Torrens kettle&mdash;the
former, weighing 8&frac12; lbs., holding twelve quarts,
and cooking for eight men, while the latter weighs
3&frac12; lbs., holds six quarts, and cooks for five men.
Whenever the ground was too wet for a trench, two
parallel sod walls answered the same purpose, and two
trenches, 10 feet long, 9 inches broad, and 12 inches
deep were allowed for a company of 120 men. The
medical arrangements were as elaborate as could be
made consistent with the limited means of transport,
but what was deficient in quantity was made up in
excellence of detail. Medical officers and stretcher-bearers
usually moved in front of the camp, and the
temporary hospital was always placed in the least
exposed position near at hand, while the field-hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
were always in rear. One medical officer was
allotted to each battalion of infantry, regiment of
cavalry, or battery of artillery&mdash;more could not be
spared. One bearer company and two field-hospitals
were allotted to each division. This bearer company
included 206 men, part natives, 101 mules or
horses, and 30 waggons. The field-hospitals had
each 75 men, 52 mules, and 10 waggons, while each
field-hospital had equipment for 200 sick. Fortunately
the health of the troops was exceptionally
good.</p>

<p>Instead of an advance from Rorke's Drift, it was
now determined to take a line from Kopje Allein
to Blood river, across the more northern spurs of
the Ingutu hills, and endeavour to ultimately strike
the road laid down in the maps, between the Alarm
and the Isipizi hills. This route was to be taken
by General Wood's flying column in advance, and
General Newdigate's division, of which actually it
was intended to form an integral portion. The
former consisted of the 13th and 90th Regiments of
Light Infantry and five companies of the 80th
Regiment, all of them in splendid and hard-working
condition, and devoted to their brilliant leader.
Wood's cavalry consisted of 900 mounted men belonging
to various corps, and commanded by the Rupert
of South Africa, Redvers Buller, whose men were
ready to follow him anywhere, and die for him to a
man, after his splendid self-devotion at Zlobani and
elsewhere. Wood, who made friends wherever he
moved, had some valuable allies in Oham's people,
who, hating the tyranny of Cetywayo, were invaluable
as scouts and spies to the flying columns. The
arrangements for the line of advance were as follows:&mdash;Wood's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
flying column was to keep in advance
of Newdigate's division by about five miles,
while in front of the former a veil of cavalry was to
keep in advance about ten miles, connected by intervening
files. Each morning orderlies were to report
whether the front and rear were perfectly clear, nor
was an advance to be made until such was known.
In case of any enemy attacking Wood, the latter
was to be at once supported by Marshall, who could
circle round and take the Zulus in the rear, a principle
of strategy they strongly object to. Crealock,
with the aid of the naval authorities, was at the
same time to push forward from Fort Chelmsford,
and, if the landing at Port Durnford was reported
practicable, force the Umvolosi and operate in conjunction
with the 2nd column from his base at Port
Durnford.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford had long seen that the best
method to obviate the almost overwhelming difficulties
of transport would be to form some seaport
on the Zulu coast. Delagoa Bay was at first
selected; but considerable difficulty was found in
arranging with the Portuguese Government as to
our landing a force in the neighbourhood, and that
scheme was consequently abandoned. It then
became evident that if a seaport, or even ever so
small a landing-place could be provided at the
mouth of the Umlalasi, it would be at once the
nearest and best base of operations for any force
moving from the Tugela upon Ulundi or Cetywayo's
other stronghold.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as far back as December, 1877, Sir
Theophilus Shepstone wrote to Sir Bartle Frere,
informing his Excellency that two gentlemen&mdash;Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
E. Rathbone and Mr. H. W. Taylor&mdash;wished to call
attention to the fact that, from personal observations
they had made, they were satisfied that a practicable
landing-place on the Zulu coast could be found.
These gentlemen, it is true, as Sir Theophilus
pointed out, differed as to the precise spot on the
coast, but both agreed that it was near the Tugela
mouth, and but a very few miles intervene between
the one place described and the other. This discovery
was made twenty-seven years ago, in the
year 1852, and, so far from being kept a secret,
was published for general information in the <i>Natal
Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>H.M. gunboat "Forester" was accordingly despatched
to thoroughly explore this part of the
coast; no less than three minute and careful
surveys were made, and finally, on May 26th, she
returned with the welcome intelligence that a fine
lagoon existed close to the mouth of the Umlalasi,
with a sheltered outlet, and that, from the soundings
taken for five miles on either side of the river,
there was no actual obstacle to a landing being
practicable at all tides and all seasons.</p>

<p>There was, however, at the mouth of the river, a
bar on which the surf broke heavily; and in bad
weather experience proved on more than one occasion
that this formed an impassable barrier even to
the most determined attempts to make a landing.</p>

<p>This spot was christened Port Durnford, and
steps were immediately taken to form there a fort
and dep&ocirc;t of supplies for the 1st column, in command
of which was General Crealock.</p>

<p>To Commodore Sullivan, Major Barrow, and the
captain of H.M.S. "Forester" principally belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the honours of the discovery; and while the sailors
worked heartily seaward and along the dangerous
and difficult coast, Barrow and his riders found out
all the roads which led to the point selected. It
had been arranged that General Crealock, with the
advanced guard of the 1st division should move
down the Umlalasi to a point carefully surveyed by
Barrow, and which was subsequently, in compliment
to the gallant young prince, called Fort
Napoleon. Thence he was to proceed to Port Durnford,
to meet the "Forester."</p>

<p>Hitherto the advance had been slow; but when
it is remembered that forts were constructed at
every strategic point of defence&mdash;at the Amatikula,
the Inyezani (respectively Forts Chelmsford and
Crealock), and the whole of the road between this
place and the Tugela had been put into working
order by fatigue parties and Engineers, it is clear
there was no real ground for complaint of the delay.
Every stream had been bridged, either with pontoons,
casks, or trestles, and trees had been cut
down, rocks and boulders blown up, as well as
gradients eased and facilities for transport carried
out. Forts Pearson, Tenedos, Chelmsford, Crealock,
and Napoleon were garrisoned by the less robust
men of the column. Six companies of the 88th,
with the headquarters, held Fort Chelmsford, while
a wing of the 99th performed the same office at Fort
Crealock. The regular communications along this
line of advanced forts were placed in charge of one
of the best men out there, namely, Colonel Hugh
Rowlands, 41st Regiment, whose eye for country, tact,
and temper with the natives and incessant vigilance
eminently qualified him for such a responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time the force of the 1st division stood as
follows:&mdash;General Crealock, Brigadiers Bray and
Rowlands; two batteries of artillery and one ammunition
column; Royal Engineers, 30th company
and C troop; infantry, six battalions, viz.:&mdash;the
Buffs, 57th, 60th, 88th, 91st, and 99th Regiments,
two squadrons of mounted infantry, the Natal Horse,
the native scouts; as pretty and compact a little
division as any moderately ambitious general could
wish to command, and it speaks well for the chief's
admirable temper under difficulties that, chafed as
he now was, and tied as it were by the leg, by want
of transport, he kept working incessantly without a
murmur at the forts, bridges, fords, roads, and other
requisites.</p>

<p>In accordance with the above-mentioned arrangement,
General Crealock, Commodore Richards, and
Lord Gifford set forth on the 25th June for Port
Durnford, taking with them the advance-guard of
the 1st division.</p>

<p>At first the road was over a level and sandy
plain, with numerous small granite hills in different
directions, and although there was not much vegetation
for the first two or three miles of the road,
it opened on to a more picturesque-looking champaign
country, where the soil appeared teeming with
fertility, and the air was balmy and pure. The
country here, however, is arid and parched during
the dry season, but in the rains, which last from
November till May, it is well watered, and large
crops of maize are grown, which by the end of June
are usually ripened and fit for cutting. Large
crops of malama are also grown, and it is upon the
stalks of this that the cattle are mostly fed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
drought, when they appear in good condition,
notwithstanding its seeming want of nutriment.</p>

<p>Here a halt was made; vedettes were placed, and
a meal was partaken of. Then, after half an hour's
rest, they again pushed on, and soon came to an
undulating and extremely romantic-looking valley,
shut in on either side by some huge granite hills.
Ascending the highest of these, they looked down
upon the Indian Ocean, Port Durnford, and the
"Forester," standing off about a mile from the
shore, and evidently on the look-out. From this
point to the outlet of the Umlalazi the country
was fairly open, and the landscape fertile and partly
cultivated. The only obstacle to progress was a
rocky and rather narrow ridge, through which,
however, ran a fairly open kloof, with a small and
tributary stream winding its way to the Umlalazi.
Here was the road, and another two hours saw
them through the kloof without question or attack,
and they cantered along the grassy slopes to the
bright and shingly beach, upon which a couple
of boat's crews, despatched when they were first
sighted, were occupied in preparing a very excellent
dinner of ship's rations for the tired and hungry
men.</p>

<p>General Crealock highly approved of the position,
and a fort and other works were at once traced
out, thus rendering complete the cordon of posts
that had been drawn all round the south of Zululand,
right from the sea to the left attack (or
2nd column), and through which it was impossible
for Cetywayo to force a way, and which rendered
his capture or submission a mere question of time.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">We</span> now come to an event which, though it in no
way affected the course or result of this war, was
nevertheless so deplorably sad in itself, as well as to
the British army, and was, furthermore, of such
world-wide interest, altering, as it undoubtedly
did, the history of one of the mightiest nations of
Europe, that no apology is required for a detailed
narrative.</p>

<p>Ever since the arrival of the Prince Imperial in
the colony he had continued to win the friendship
and esteem of all ranks, and his unassuming quietude
and modesty, genial humour, and readiness to learn
the most minute details of the profession he had
adopted, made him a universal favourite. It has
been previously mentioned that the Prince had
been engaged in several reconnaissances, and only
three days before his death he had been with
Lord Chelmsford upon a patrol extending more
than twenty miles into the Zulu country. On
May the 28th General Wood received orders to
move parallel to, but slightly in advance, of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Newdigate's column, from Kopje Allein, in a
south-easterly direction towards the Itelezi hill.
After three days had been spent in carefully exploring
the country, General Newdigate moved
forward on June 1st with his division, as nearly
as possible 10,000 strong, and with a baggage train
of 480 waggons. The country had been carefully
scouted by Buller's Horse for twenty miles round,
and no Zulus were reported near. On the evening
of the 1st the column laagered not far from the
Itelezi, and on the following day the General moved
south-east along a level country towards the Inguita
range; and the flying column being one march
ahead, a communication was kept up by the vedettes
of General Newdigate and General Wood. On
Sunday, the 1st, General Wood with a small escort
reconnoitred in advance of the column, which was
about five miles in advance of General Newdigate's
force. Away on the right and left were Buller's
horsemen dotting the ridges of the hills on either
side. In front lay green slopes, which were
traversed here and there by watercourses, and
bounded by the most singularly shaped mountains,
flat at the summit and crowned with a sort
of rocky dome. A good deal of rain had fallen in
the night, and the morning was as clear and fresh
as a May day in England. The General and his
escort had ridden about six miles, when the path
suddenly made a bend to the left, skirting a clump
of trees, which grew near the edge of the stream.
Pushing a way through thick thorny underwood
mingled with date-palms and tall reeds, they at
length looked down upon the still deep waters of a
narrow river, flowing across a long red sandbank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
A ledge of granite formed a rugged barrier eight
feet or ten feet high across the river, and down the
hollows of this the clear water rushed and gurgled
in fantastic rills, cascades, and rapids, bubbling and
eddying among the great masses of rock above, in
many of which great holes were worn by stones
which during the floods had settled in small hollows.
Traversing a sandstone hill, with a long spur
stretching away to the eastward, and rising in cliffs
of 300 feet to the south of the river, they came upon
a grove of fan-palms and mimosa, where the banks
of the stream were covered with golden-blossomed
acacias. Crossing the river by an easy ford, they
had ridden on about another mile, when they
observed some of the vedettes on the high ground
to the left signalling that horsemen were approaching.
Soon they came out upon an immense cultivated
flat, terminating to the right in a long, dark,
and winding gorge, black with bush, and arched
by huge precipices of sandstone and granite. Into
this they turned, and, following a Kaffir path marked
with tracks made by Buller's men, they came upon
a bush of about six or seven acres, in the centre of
which were the remains of a burnt kraal and marks
of recent fighting. On the edge of a small stream
they discovered a path to the extreme right, in fact
quite on the hillside, and here the surface showed
numerous boot-marks, where the scouts had
evidently been. They had now reached a plain,
from which they were divided by a broad and well-worn
watercourse, and here they were joined by
three or four vedettes, who came to report that they
had noticed some horsemen coming at a rapid canter
from the direction of the Tombalaka and the Iyohgazi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
rivers, which were about equidistant between
Wood's late camp and that of General Newdigate.
They had not long to wait for the solution of the
mystery, for, riding in the direction of the horsemen,
they were met by Colonel Buller and a dozen of his
men, who was equally anxious with General Wood
to discover who the fugitives could be. They all
rode on together, and rounding the base of the cliff
came up with Lieutenant Carey and four troopers
of Bettington's Horse. In a few seconds more the
terrible secret was revealed, and Lieutenant Carey,
whose horse was almost dead beat, and covered
with foam, was rapidly relating to General Wood
the details. "Where is the Prince?" exclaimed
Wood, as he breasted his horse at some fallen trees
which intervened, and dashed forward to meet the
fugitives. "Speak, sir; what has happened?"
"The Prince, I fear, is killed, sir," said one of the
men, Carey being at first unable to speak. "Is
that the case? Tell me instantly, sir," answered the
General. "I fear 'tis so, General," was the answer;
upon which our chief exclaimed, "And what are
you, sir, doing here?" A veil must be drawn over
the rest of the interview, which was of the most
painful character. A short despatch was at once
written while on horseback by the General, and in
this a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the fearful tragedy was told, how
English soldiers had had the unutterable shame of
seeing an English officer and four English troopers
unwounded and escaped from a Zulu ambush, in
which a gallant young Prince, the guest of England
and the hope of France, had been barbarously slain.
This letter was at once despatched by the General
to headquarters, where he ordered Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Carey and his party to proceed and make their
report.</p>

<p>The story elicited from Carey and the four men,
in spite of a few discrepancies, was in the main as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 1st of June, the Prince learnt
that a patrol was to be sent out in advance of the
column, to choose the site for the camp on the following
day, and his Highness at once applied for
and obtained permission to accompany it. At six
o'clock on Sunday morning the Prince Imperial sent
for his groom, and consulted him as to what horse
he should ride, and the man strongly advised him
not to take the large grey horse, which was eventually
one of the causes of his death. This animal
was not one of those selected for the Prince by Sir
John Bissett, who had assisted him in the choice of
others. He was a big, awkward-looking, but very
powerful animal, but an inveterate buck-jumper, and,
moreover, excessively timid under fire, a fault which
in a charger is dangerous to the last degree. Two
of the Prince's horses had died, either on the voyage
out or soon after landing, and upon the fatal Sunday
the grey horse was the only steed not lame or
upon the sick report, so he had to be taken as a case
of "Hobson's choice." At seven o'clock a note arrived
addressed to the Prince, in which he was
informed that permission was accorded him to go
with the patrol about to be sent on to choose next
day's camping-ground. This note was from Colonel
Harrison, the acting quarter-master-general, and the
Prince at once went over to his tent, and received
final instructions from him verbally; which it must
be assumed, were in accordance with the wishes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the Commander-in-chief, who expressly stated that
the Prince was to be well cared for, to have no military
responsibility, and yet, at the same time, was
not to be interfered with, or in any way prevented
from seeing the country. Lieutenant Carey's account
of these matters is somewhat at variance with this
statement of Colonel Harrison, as he (Carey) says
that he was told that the Prince was to have the
entire charge of the escort and the entire duty of
selecting the camp. Lieutenant Carey says in his
written statement, that it was by his express desire
that he was named to accompany the escort, and he
made this request in consequence of his knowledge
of the country and, in some degree, of the language.
Six men of Captain Bettington's Horse and the same
number of Shepstone's Basutos were ordered to
parade at half-past eight a.m. as escort, but for some
hitherto unexplained reason the latter never appeared,
and when Carey suggested they should wait
for them the Prince, with that utter contempt for
danger for which he was always remarkable, exclaimed,
"Oh, no; we are quite strong enough!"
At nine a.m. all was ready, a frugal breakfast of
black coffee and biscuit had been partaken of, saddles,
carbines, swords, revolvers, and accoutrements had
been carefully inspected, and the word was given to
"mount" and "away!" Before leaving the camp,
however, a message was sent to Captain Shepstone
to say that the escort would halt and wait for the
six Basutos on the ridge between the Incenzi and
Itelezi hills. A messenger was again sent to hurry
on these natives, but it seems they never came, and
therefore the patrol consisted only of the Prince,
Lieutenant Carey, six mounted men of Bettington's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Horse, and one friendly Zulu. This was certainly
not a fit escort for such a charge, and it seems impossible
not to attach a grave responsibility to
the staff officer who made the detail. All the six
Europeans were well armed and well mounted, their
weapons consisting of the Martini-Henry slung
across the back, ammunition in bandoleer, and a
stout serviceable knife, which could be used for
meals or on emergency as a weapon at close quarters.
The Prince and Lieutenant Carey had not rifles, but
swords and revolvers, and unfortunately the latter
were not worn upon the person as they invariably
should be, but in the holsters. The Prince had been
on several visits to General Wood's camp, and was
an enthusiastic admirer of both Wood and Buller,
with the latter of whom he had become very intimate
ever since the last two patrols he had made with him.
With Lieutenant Carey his Imperial Highness had
also an intimacy of some standing, and as Carey's
skill as a draughtsman was well known in the camp,
he had been selected on several occasions to assist
his Highness in surveying operations.</p>

<p>The day had broken on this fated Sunday with all
the glory of a real South African morning. It had
been raining during the night, but this only served
to give a more delightful perfume to the odorous
plants that were crushed by the hoofs of the horses
belonging to the escort. The rain of the previous
day and night had refreshed the ground, and filled
the various pools with water, and the plains were
cheerful with the animals and birds coming out of
the bush to feed. The patrol met with no adventure
for some time, but continued its course along a valley
running north-east, and narrowing gradually. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
track in some places crossed bad spruits, and was
undefined, and in parts obliterated by thorn-trees
and bush. It was also commanded here and there
by projecting spurs and bluffs, where an enemy could
have easily hidden in force, and have attacked them
at an advantage, but on either side could be seen the
friendly Basutos scouting in the distance. The
watershed of the mountain was reached about an
hour after the patrol started, and on arriving at the
ridge the Prince and Lieutenant Carey dismounted,
as they wished to fix the position of some important
hills with their compasses. Here Colonel Harrison
overtook them, and remarked that the whole of the
escort was not with them, adding that the patrol had
better wait for the Basutos to come up. The Prince
said, "Oh, we are quite strong enough. Besides, we
have all our friends around us, and with my glass
I can see General Marshall's cavalry coming up."
Lieutenant Carey, as soon as he had finished his
sketch, proposed to off-saddle and breakfast; but he
states that the Prince overruled this suggestion
and expressed a wish to push on to the river. The
patrol accordingly proceeded on for about four miles,
where for some distance the way was along the
bottom of a deep sandy nullah with very precipitous
sides, which they were forced to take as the only
practicable place. This at length debouched into
an open space, from which there appeared to be an
entrance to a disused kraal some two miles up the
ravine. Here the escort found that there was good
drinking-water in some pools under a large kopje in
front, situated in a complete amphitheatre of hills,
and upon this kopje were some of our Basuto skirmishers.
After watering the horses, the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
advanced for a mile and a half along a commanding
and rocky range of hills a short distance beyond the
Ilyotosi river. Here Carey again proposed to off-saddle,
but the Prince did not approve of the spot,
and after some more sketching and surveying the
country with telescopes and compass, the valley was
descended as far as an isolated kraal, and the order
was given to off-saddle. The Prince, who did not
appear very strong, now complained of being tired,
and while coffee was being prepared lay down beside
the door of a hut.</p>

<p>The place where this halt was made would appear,
from the statements of Lieutenant Carey and the
surviving men of the escort, to be about as ill-chosen
and suspicious a locality as could be found. The
kraal where they now were consisted of about half a
dozen huts, and was situated about three hundred
yards from the river Moazani (so called by the Zulu
who accompanied the party). Between the kraal
and the river stretched a tall and luxuriant growth
of that most dangerous cover, five, six, and seven
feet in height, Tambookie grass interspersed here
and there, as is customary, with equally tall mealies
and Kaffir corn. The plains beneath this spot afforded
every temptation to the artistic eye of the
Prince, and here again another sketch of the panorama
was quickly made. The bright glowing tints
of the foreground, whose colours were lit up by green
and fresh grass and wide-spreading acacia and flowering
shrubs, well mellowed away in the middle distance,
while far away towards the horizon were to be seen
the shadowy outlines of the blue Itelezi hills. The
kraal was not completely surrounded, for in front
there was an open space where broken cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
utensils and burnt-out embers, bones, and other
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>, showed that the place had not long ago been
occupied. Some hungry-looking dogs came out and
snarled at the intruders. Here the fatal order was
given to off-saddle, and, in defiance of the most
common and ordinary precautions, which the merest
tyro should have taken, the horses were knee-haltered
and turned out to graze, while coffee was
prepared, and not the slightest search made in the
cover around.</p>

<p>The friendly Zulu was sent down to the river for
water, and also to see that the horses did not stray
too far. All this time a party of Zulus, supposed to
have been about thirty or forty, were concealed and
watching the doomed party, who, utterly unsuspicious
of an ambush, were seated around, chatting
and sipping their coffee. A deep donga lay right
across the path subsequently taken by the fugitives,
and this served to screen the enemy as he stealthily
crawled to his prey. Stealing noiselessly along,
hidden by the rank vegetation, and unheard by the
unwatchful escort, the savages came nearer and
nearer to their quarry, but while creeping along
were descried by the watchful eyes of the Kaffir,
who, not losing a second, darted back to the Prince,
and gave the warning of danger. A little delay
now occurs, for his Highness fails to understand the
native, who has to appeal to Corporal Grubb, one of
the escort, to interpret. The corporal explains to
the Prince, who looks at his watch, and (we are
told) seeing it was ten minutes to four, says, "You
can give your horses ten minutes more." But this
must have been countermanded, for the horses were
at once collected, and in a few moments were prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to start. The Prince is carefully and calmly
examining his bit and bridle, and, it is surmised, had
not sufficiently tightened his girths. His grey horse
is a fidgety, troublesome animal to mount, and now
appears to be nervous and anxious to break away.
Meanwhile all the escort stand to their horses and
await the word, which the Prince now gives, "Prepare
to mount." But this was the death-signal, for
hardly had the order escaped the lips that gave
it, and that spoke no other word on earth, than the
fearful traditional "Usulu! Usulu!" awoke the
echoes of the valley, and a tremendous volley was
poured in from the favouring cover of the grass and
mealies. All the horses swerved instinctively with
terror, and some broke away. Private Rogers was
shot before he could mount, and the Prince's tall
grey, half mad with fright, became impossible to
mount. Where is the English iron nerve that is
proof against the panic of a moment? Where are
the guardians of England's princely guest? All
have lost their courage and their sense of manhood.
<i>Sauve qui peut!</i> is the craven spirit of those who
had they rallied back to back could have probably
saved a noble life and preserved a nation's honour.
Not a carbine was loaded, not a sentry placed.
Surprise, the most unsoldierlike crime, was allowed,
and white with fear each trooper galloped away to
save himself, nor drew bridle-rein till miles of
country placed safety in his path. Meanwhile, the
gallant and unfortunate Prince is losing every chance
of escape which the slightest attempt at succour
would have given. One friendly hand to steady the
scared and ill-broken steed; one carbine, even
unloaded, presented at the bush&mdash;for the savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
had not dared to come forth&mdash;or one gallant heart
like Buller, Leet, or Wood to have shown the
chivalry of France that England's sons were worthy
of their ancient fame, and the Prince would have
been alive to-day. There is, it is true, the testimony
of one man, borne away by his frightened and
possibly wounded horse, who says that not being
more than half in the saddle, and having no control
over his mount, he could not stay to aid the Prince.
"D&eacute;p&ecirc;chez-vous, monsieur!" he cried, as he swept
by at a racing gallop, and that was all the warning
he could give. And then&mdash;oh, shame and humiliation!&mdash;this
young lad, schooled to arms with
English soldiers' sons, wearing an English uniform,
and escorted by British soldiers to a bloody grave,
was left alone to be speared to death, without a sword
being drawn or a shot fired, even from a distance, in
his defence.</p>

<p>The Zulus, seeing only one man unable to mount,
burst at length from their treacherous cover, and
with fiendish yells rush upon the Prince, who, holding
the stirrup-leather with one hand and the
holster-flap with the other, must have made one
final and desperate attempt to spring into the saddle.
But all is in vain, the untrustworthy leather gives
way in his hand; his feet slip from under him; he
falls beneath the horse, which treads upon his body
and gallops away! The last that was seen of the
Empress's beloved son was, that he was alone and
on foot, with some dozen Zulus poising their assegais
within a few feet from him, and his body was
afterwards found pierced in front with some eighteen
or twenty thrusts, and stripped of all but his mother's
amulet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot have escaped the reader that there are
some discrepancies and anachronisms in the accounts
given by Lieutenant Carey and the survivors of that
fatal and ill-omened day, the 1st of June. These
contradictions were not unnoticed by General Wood
when he took down the report and forwarded it to
the headquarter camp. In the first place we are
told that the Prince was too rash and venturesome,
and that he nearly lost his life on the day when,
accompanied by Major Bettington, some of his men,
and a party of Basutos, he visited a Zulu kraal in
the neighbourhood of the camp, and was fired upon
by the enemy. Now, on this as on former occasions,
when the Prince went out with Colonel Buller, Lord
Chelmsford, and other officers in charge of patrols
or reconnaissances, he was perfectly well aware that
he was merely incurring the same risk as were other
English officers, whose lives to the British nation, if
not to France, were as valuable as his, and whose
temerity&mdash;if such it can be called&mdash;was absolutely
necessary to the conduct of the campaign. But on
the last fatal occasion his Highness was allowed to
go alone, or virtually alone, for Lieutenant Carey
does not seem to have taken his honest and proper
share of responsibility, or looked after the most
ordinary precautions which a subaltern of a week's
standing would have carried out in a time of profound
peace. We are told that the Prince gave all
orders and words of command during the day, that
he selected, approved of, and disapproved of each
halting-place that was arrived at, and that when
Lieutenant Carey wished the escort to muster and
leave the deserted kraal at a certain hour the Prince
demurred, and gave the order to stay much longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Now this, if authentic, indicates a lack of military
knowledge which it is difficult to understand as
appertaining to an officer of Lieutenant Carey's
standing. The rule of the service is imperative,
and no civilian, no volunteer, and no guest, whatever
his rank, may, can, or should at least be allowed
to give a word of command when an official authority
is present. If Lieutenant Carey, out of compliment
or out of courtesy, allowed the Prince Imperial to
choose the halting-places and to give the words of
command to the troopers, whom he and not his
Highness commanded, he betrayed an ignorance of
the customs, duties, and etiquette of his profession
which renders him totally unfit for the possession of
her Majesty's commission. If he did not allow our
deplored and gallant guest to select these halts, to
choose the places for "off-saddle," and to give the
necessary cautions and words of command in regard
to mounting, why, then, he is still more to blame,
as knowing, as he should have known, that he and
not the Prince was in command, his first and transparently
obvious duty was to post vedettes and keep
a soldierlike look-out on all sides. Lieutenant
Carey was specially ordered to take half a dozen
Basutos with him, in addition to the scanty escort
allotted by the Quarter-Master-General of six of
Bettington's Horse. He says that the escort of
Basutos never came, and that the Prince, when told
of their absence, would not wait, but insisted on
pushing forward. The captain of a ship who, at
the instance of an impatient passenger, puts to sea
with only half his water and provisions on board,
endangers the lives of those under his command,
and for ever forfeits his claim to future confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
in his conduct and prudence. We are told that as
the first division and the flying column of General
Wood were on converging lines, and were rapidly
approaching, and that as the ground over which this
fatal reconnaissance was made had been previously
explored by the Prince, Lieutenant Carey was justified
in arriving at the illogical conclusion that it
must be safe from an enemy. A more preposterous
assertion was never before made to hoodwink and
blind justice. Why, not a day passed during this
unhappy war when the troops, in all their camps,
were not dogged and followed by parties more or
less numerous, whose duties were to lie in wait for
and cut off any imprudent scouts or stragglers from
the camp. The officer in command of the escort
should have been aware of this, and should have
known that the fact of a particular neighbourhood
or kraal having been searched a week previously
and found deserted afforded no presumption that the
locality would not be full of Kaffirs some days further
on.</p>

<p>After the word "Mount" was given by the
Prince, a fact which is to most minds somewhat
doubtful, we are told that the volley of musketry
was fired, and that some of the horses broke away,
while that of the Prince became so frightened that
he could not be mounted. "One by one the party
galloped past the Prince, who was in vain endeavouring
to mount." Where was the friend and associate
of England's guest? Where was the officer who had
specially applied for this sacred and most honourable
duty? Where, we want to know, was the English
officer in command of the "escort"? His place
was with his men, not leading them away with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
backs to the paltry handful of Zulus, which, it is now
known, were in the mealies, but holding the ground,
and covering the body of his charge. The captain
of a sinking or waterlogged vessel is not the first
man in the boats, leaving passengers and crew to
sink without him. His place is upon his deck,
trumpet in hand, and even if death-doomed, sinking
like an Englishman under the shadow of the British
flag. Such, comparatively, was the place and the
<i>devoir</i> of the officer in command of the Prince's escort,
and had he devoted one brief half-moment to see and
aid our guest to his saddle he would, even if killed
or wounded in the act, have earned a name in every
English and French household more cherished and
lustrous than the star of valour which our Queen
gives to her bravest men.</p>

<p>We now come to the statements of the survivors,
and here we are at a considerable loss to reconcile
the accounts. It is distinctly mentioned by one
witness that the abandoned Prince was seen vainly
endeavouring to spring into the saddle by the aid of
the holster and the cantle. The story must be
received with considerable reservation, if not utter
mistrust. The Prince, it is well-known, was a most
accomplished horseman, and especially distinguished
by his proficiency in all the arts and minuti&aelig; of the
<i>man&eacute;ge</i>, and he therefore would be most unlikely to
attempt to mount in the way described. Almost
the first lesson given in the riding-school to a recruit
is the one which teaches the method of mounting
the horse. The merest novice in military equitation
must be aware that the first motion with the left
hand is to grasp a lock of the mane, before placing
the right hand upon the cantle of the saddle, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
horse's back if not saddled. The Prince was too
well-drilled a cavalier to think of mounting by grasping
either the saddle-flap, holster, or stirrup-leather,
either of which would tend to turn a loosely-girthed
saddle round under the horse. If the witnesses had
sufficient time to minutely describe the details of the
Prince's desperate struggle, they undoubtedly had
equal time and opportunity to have drawn rein and
assisted him to mount. From all that can be gleaned
of a reliable nature, it would appear that the one
exception of devotion and courage displayed in this
otherwise disgraceful affair was exhibited by the
friendly Zulu who was with the party. He it was
who first discovered the proximity of the enemy,
and who, not being mounted, might have had some
excuse for trying to save his life by timely flight.
But he stayed loyally and gallantly with his white
comrades, and came back with quiet and deliberate
consideration to give warning of the concealed Zulus.
Even then it would appear that he did not attempt
to fly, but fought with his breast to the foe until
overcome by numbers. This poor fellow's body was
afterwards discovered not far from that of the
Prince, riddled with wounds, and in a pool of his
own and the enemy's blood, together with a number
of his own assegais broken, but reeking with the
gore of his assailants. Doubtless, the first and real
great error was committed by the Prince and his
party advancing without the Basutos detailed to
accompany them. Had these native scouts, whose
powers of observation and eyesight so far exceed
those of any white man, that no reconnaissance was
considered complete without them, paraded as they
had been ordered to, it is beyond question that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
would have detected the vicinity of the concealed
Zulus, and a fearful tragedy would have been
averted.</p>

<p>The sad news thrilled the whole camp. In every
tent, and amongst each group of old and young
soldiers around the bivouac fires, the tidings were
discussed during the whole of the evening, and late
into the night. General Newdigate was applied to
by General Marshall for permission to take out a
cavalry patrol, during the night, to recover the body
of the ill-fated Prince, but the former thought it
would be more prudent to wait for the daylight.
At four a.m., however, two squadrons were paraded
in front of the camp, and, under General Marshall's
command, proceeded in the direction of the plateau
three miles above the junction of the Tombolaka
and Ityolyozi rivers&mdash;about equidistant between
the cavalry camp at the Incetu Neck and that of
Wood at the Munhla hill, and some twelve miles
from either. About eight miles from Incetu the
horsemen came to a bend of the river, and after
crossing the spruit, which in the rainy season helps
to fill the Ityolyozi, they came to the base of one of
those flat-topped hills which are so common in this
country. With some considerable difficulty they
ascended to the summit of this kop, from which was
obtained a splendid view of the river below as it
wound along the valley, and at the further end fell
over a ledge of rock by a directly perpendicular
descent of 150 feet high and fifty feet wide. Here
the water whirled down into the abyss beneath, and
seemed to be carried off in a serpentine form
through a deep channel between great red scarped
rocks. In the ascent to the kop several small but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
well-built Zulu kraals were passed, and it was
noticed that the huts were very neatly built. The
wickerwork was made of wattles, light and straight,
and bent over at regular distances. The kraals
were well plastered and very neatly thatched, while
the doors were made rather small, with the flooring
hard and smooth. At the upper end there
was a raised ledge running right across the hut,
which served as a cupboard where all utensils are
placed. Firewood was neatly packed inside between
two grass copes which were fastened against the wall.
The furniture was scanty and all of native manufacture,
and some large clay pots to hold native beer
were in several of the huts. Looking down over
the ground dividing the lower ground from the
higher range, a fine view broke upon the eye in the
foreground. Mount Munhla stood well out of the
range upon the plain like some huge bastion, while
behind it endless grassy slopes filled up the foreground
of the picture. The hill ascended was one
of the spots selected by the Prince for his sketches,
and here it was that the party had made their first
halt. Here they could be in no danger of surprise,
and well would it have been if the party had chosen
an equally safe position to off-saddle on Sunday.
There is no doubt that the Prince's talent with the
pencil and the pen, combined with his remarkable
proficiency in military surveying, while making his
services so valuable to the army, contributed in no
inconsiderable manner to the risks which on several
occasions he ran. From this spot, the Prince,
when he had finished his sketches, pointed out to
Lieutenant Carey the kraal at which he had been
fired at on a previous occasion. From here might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
be seen the Umbazini, about two miles farther on,
and the kraal, consisting of five huts, where the
Prince was killed. Vedettes were now ordered to
push along the ridges to right and left, and to
signal as they advanced, while the main body of
horsemen, in sections of fours, were led by the
General down the north-eastern side of the krantz.
It was an interesting sight to see the long blue and
white line of horsemen winding like a huge serpent
round the sides of the mountain; the steel-topped
bamboo lances and fluttering pennons glistening
bravely in the morning sunlight, while the horses'
hoofs, noiseless upon the soft and elastic veldt, were
in harmony with the silence and sad expression that
were maintained in the ranks. From the General
and all the officers to the rear-rank files there was a
subdued and solemn determination of countenance
which was far more eloquent in sympathy for their
dead comrade than any words could speak, while
might be seen, at the same time, in every eye and
on every lip, a stern resolve of retribution should
opportunity occur. The cry of "English cowards!"
so often hurled at our men at Ekowe, at Zlobani, at
Kambula, Ginghilovo, and, above all, on the fatal
Sunday, was rankling in the hearts of our men, as
they longed to find themselves in the presence of a
Zulu force. As they rode cautiously yet speedily
down the slopes of the mountain and came nearer
and nearer to the place of blood, low whispers and
murmurs in subdued accents were heard in the
ranks, bronzed and bearded faces seemed to grow
more ironlike and hard, weapons were grasped with
a tighter clutch, and every eye scanned and searched
the horizon for a hidden enemy. No trumpet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
sounded, but lance signals were employed to tell
the vedettes to close in upon the column as it
advanced nearer to the kraal. Now could be seen
the long and luxuriant patches of Tambookie grass
and mealies intermixed which gave shelter to the
foe, and whose proximity was so strangely and
unaccountably ignored by the escort of the Prince.</p>

<p>In front, with General Marshall and two other
officers of the 17th Lancers, rode Captain Wyatt-Edgell,
their eyes fixed on the donga, where the
massacre&mdash;for it is difficult to give it another name&mdash;took
place. Would the lifeless remains of one
whose bright spirit was part of a widowed and
stricken life, whose pure and Christian nature
ennobled the profession of strife to which his heart
was devoted, be left intact by the savages or
mutilated by the instincts of their brutal superstition?
Would the young, calm, and somewhat sad eyes so
well remembered by each be torn or defaced by the
vulture, or his still more repugnant rival the common
aasvogel (gyps fulvus), and would that lithe and
graceful form which used to lounge at evening into
the homely bell-tent and interchange camp gossip and
pleasant badinage with glad and devoted comrades&mdash;would
all these be gone to human sight and ken?
Were they to have the mournful and defeated joy of
bearing those poor shorn relics back even one stage
on the way to a broken-hearted mother's hearth; or
had the wild dog and the eagle feasted upon all that
once was the pride and the hope of Imperial Gaul?
As they neared the horrible pit, for it was nothing
more, where the boy so well loved by all had given
his spirit to Him who gave it, they were startled
and horror-stricken at the sight of some bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
vultures, hawks, falcons, and secretary-birds, which
mounted on the wing from the long, dank grasses
as the advance was made; and they shuddered at
the thought of the ghoul-like banquet of which they
might have partaken. But a deep and impassable
kloof had to be crossed, and although time was of the
greatest importance at that moment, General Marshall
was too good a <i>sabreur</i> to hazard the lives of the
living without precaution, in order to recover the
relics of the dead. Consequently, as it was quite
possible that the foes might have discovered how
valued was the life which had been so carelessly
squandered, and that a large force might be hidden
in other and neighbouring ambush, the usual simple
but most effectual precautions were taken while the
advance was continued. Vedettes were again thrown
out, lance in sling and carbine on thigh. Oh! what
a moment of pride for Drury-Lowe, for Boulderson,
for Edgell, for Cooke, or for "Dick" Boyle (had he
been there to see). Every trooper's eye gleamed
with excitement, every thigh pressed the horse's
flank, and every heart throbbed with unspeakable
rapture at the thought that a chance might be
gained to dash as an <i>enfant perdu</i> at the Golgotha
where the dead friends should be, even though the
living enemies were waiting to wrap and twine them
in their grim embrace. Twelve men were selected
to ride to the right, left, and front, and report.
They had orders to dash at once into the bush
should a Zulu appear. To run away in the open
before these people is not only madness, but almost
certain death to those whose misfortune it is to be
left behind; but the merest tyro in North American,
South African, or, indeed, any bush warfare, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
know that once in the bush the assailed well armed
is more than a match for the antagonist ill armed.
But a ravine yet intervened between them and the
scene of slaughter, and they were compelled to
make a somewhat wide d&eacute;tour, during the passage
of which, however, each eye and ear was on the <i>qui-vive</i>
to the slightest rustle of branch or bough.</p>

<p>A group of officers were riding in front; but one
topic could be discussed&mdash;a sad and yet a cherished
and welcome theme. There is that peculiar temperament
and idiosyncrasy about the soldier, a mixture of
sentiment, poetry, and practical common sense, which
makes up a philosophy all its own, and a measure
of life and death, which no man who holds not his
life in the hollow of his palm can pretend to comprehend.
"<i>D&eacute;p&ecirc;chez-vous, s'il vous plait, monsieur</i>,"
rang in every ear, and seemed to be echoed through
the eldritch and ghostlike solitudes of the greystones
and caverns above. The ravens, disturbed at their
approach, screamed as they passed on, while the
monkeys, nestling among the luxuriant clusters of
imporotla or peopisi,&mdash;fruit whose pods, three feet
long, full of large broad beans, hanging from the
branches like cucumbers or sausages, gave a singular,
a cultivated, and almost civilized aspect to the
scene,&mdash;seemed as wishing to point out the spot
where the gallant young Prince was slain.</p>

<p>Some Zulus, about one hundred in number, were
now seen hiding in bushes and caves; but they were
quickly dislodged by a party of dismounted Lancers
under Adjutant Frith, a smart officer and worthy
follower in the old traditions of his corps. The line
then brought its shoulders sharply round to the left,
and covered the five huts forming the kraal, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the officers in front galloped through the tambookie
grass and maize, and posted vedettes at each angle
of the plantation. Taking open order, General
Marshall now advanced and surrounded the donga,
and, dismounting himself, with three other officers,
descended the slopes of the worn and steep shelter
that held what once was a bright and gallant
spirit.</p>

<p>A small bank of sand, over which the sparse and
struggling wild flowers were striving to blossom and
flourish, gave a pillow to the young Prince, whose
body divested of all clothing, and stripped bare save
for a charm or locket round his neck, lay extended,
not in writhed contortion, but graceful as in slumber.
The face was composed and almost smiling, and
looked up to the sky towards which the pure and
unselfish spirit had soared. No trace of a violent
and bloody death could be seen on the fair and unwrinkled
brow, where the lines of thought, care, and
sorrow, were as yet unploughed. The eyes were
open, and seemed to gaze up with human sympathy,
though one was injured by a cruel wound which
gashed the lid and eyebrow. The body was not
mutilated, and save for the eighteen assegai wounds
in the chest and front, no desecration of the clay
had been committed. The left arm lay across the
chest as if striving to shield the heart from some
cruel thrust, while the right grasped in deathly
rigour a tuft of human hair, which showed in conclusive
evidence that the boy must have had time to
close in the last death-struggle with one at least of
his assailants. Beyond this fact, the ground near
where the body lay was trampled and tossed, while
here and there, in the direction towards which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Zulus fled, dark congealed clots of blood were still
to be seen. Hence the conclusion that the generous
and high-souled boy, whom all loved so well, had
preserved, if not his revolver (which probably was
left in his holster), at least his sword, and that,
accomplished swordsman as he was, even in his
mortal agony he had been able to sell his life
dearly, and strike as he fell. Hard-hearted and
hard-headed troopers, impervious to danger and
to hardships, bowed their heads in sorrow and
shame to their horses' manes, while the fierce light
of battle which is to be seen when the trumpet
sounds the "charge" gleamed through the mist
of tears, as these honest fellows looked upon the
remains of him whose gashed body seemed to appeal
to them. But the sad duty was but half achieved,
and, under the kind supervision of General Marshall,
a soldier's bier was quickly improvised of 17th
lances, covered with cut rushes and mealies laid
above, while a horseman's cloak lay like a shroud
to cover the whole. Tenderly and reverently as
soldiers only can lift was the body lifted to its
carriage, and it was carried in relays by loving
and respectful hands back over the long and difficult
road to the camp, where, on the same day,
the whole of the division paraded to do honour
to the dead. When the camp was nearly reached
a messenger was sent on, and General Newdigate
and his staff came out to meet the sad <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>,
and when inside the lines, a gun-carriage was
brought, upon which, decently wrapped in linen
clothes and covered with the Union Jack, the
remains were tenderly laid, while the funeral service
was impressively performed by the Rev. Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Ballard, the Roman Catholic chaplain, Lord Chelmsford,
who was deeply affected, being the chief
mourner. The same evening the corpse was enclosed
in a rough deal coffin and conveyed by a
mule waggon to Maritzburg. It was met bare-headed
by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Colonial
Secretary, General Sir John Bissett, and General
Clifford, while minute-guns were fired from the
fort, and all the flags were at half-mast. Here
again there was an elaborate and impressive funeral,
the coffin being carried by the representatives of
every branch of the service, and followed out of the
town by the whole of the large garrison, the civic
authorities, and the Roman Catholic, Protestant,
and Dissenting clergy. At Durban, where the
remains arrived on the 10th inst., the body was
received by the Mayor and Corporation. The streets
leading to the Roman Catholic Church were lined
by the garrison, leaning on their arms, reversed,
and a requiem mass was celebrated the same day.
The following morning the coffin was received
on board her Majesty's ship "Boadicea," being
escorted to the point of embarkation by the naval
and military authorities, while the sad boom of the
minute-guns accompanied the procession. The
"Boadicea" then sailed for Simon's Bay. Arrived
there, the relics were transferred to her Majesty's
ship "Orontes," and so conveyed to England. After
identification and lying in state at the Woolwich
Arsenal, the body was conveyed to the Empress's
residence at Chiselhurst; there, with all the pomp
and pageantry of full military honours, it was laid
in the tomb in the same chapel, where rest the
remains of his loved father, Napoleon III., Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of France. The utmost sympathy was shown for
his bereaved mother by the whole English nation,
from highest to lowest. The Queen in person
attended the funeral at Chiselhurst, and amongst
the pall-bearers were the Prince of Wales, the Duke
of Cambridge, the Duke of Connaught, the Duke of
Edinburgh, and Prince Leopold.</p>

<p>A court-martial was held on Lieutenant Carey, on
the charge of having behaved in an unsoldierlike
manner in face of the foe; but the sentence was
kept secret, awaiting its confirmation by the Commander-in-chief
in England. Meanwhile Lieutenant
Carey was sent home under arrest. On his arrival
there the proceedings of the court-martial were
declared null and void on account of some technical
irregularity, and he was ordered to resume his
duties.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It is untrue that he has since received a high staff appointment.</p></div>

<p>It was generally understood that the sentence was
dismissal from the service with ignominy, but that
it was not confirmed by the special desire of the
Empress, who made a personal request to the Queen
that nothing should be done in the matter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="bq1">March of the 2nd column&mdash;Kopje Allein&mdash;Climate of the locality&mdash;Sickness

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Two</span> special orders were issued by Lord Chelmsford's
command in regard to this most melancholy affair.
The first, dated Pietermaritzburg, June 5, was signed
by General Clifford:&mdash;"The Inspector-General of
Lines of Communication and Base has received
from his Excellency the Lieut.-General Commanding
official confirmation of the calamity which has befallen
the forces under his command, by the death, on duty
in the field, of the late gallant young soldier, the
Prince Imperial Louis Napoleon, who, having, in his
military training, been lately associated with the
British Army, came out to this country to take part
in the Zulu campaign. The General feels that he is
carrying out the wishes of his Excellency the Lieut.-General
Commanding now in Zululand, by thus
recording the feelings of deep sorrow and sympathy,
experienced by every officer and man whose duty
keeps him at his post in the colony with the loss thus
sustained."</p>

<p>The second order was issued by Major Butler to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the troops at Durban, and expressed the feeling and
sympathy of all the columns:&mdash;"In following the
coffin which holds the body of the late Prince Imperial
of France, and paying to his ashes the final
tribute of sorrow and honour, the troops of the garrison
will remember that he was the last inheritor of
a mighty name and great military renown; secondly,
that he was the son of England's firm allies in dangerous
days; and, thirdly, that he was the sole child
of a widowed Empress, now left throneless and childless
in exile upon English shores, deepening the
profound sorrow and solemn reverence to those
memories. The troops will also remember that the
Prince Imperial of France fell fighting as a British
soldier."</p>

<p>On the 28th of May the second column or division
quitted the camp at Landsman's Drift, and proceeded
to Kopje Allein, which is near the Blood river, being
about a mile to the north-east of it, at a point
as near as possible to the junction of that stream
with the Buffalo. The position of the camp there
was all that could be desired, and the character of
the country was much more favourable than most of
the previously selected camps, inasmuch as no enemy
could approach without being seen for several miles.
At Kopje Allein there was a further concentration,
and several reinforcements were received, the consequence
being that the whole force amounted to
2500 British infantry, 1100 British cavalry, 300
Artillery, 100 Engineers, 66 Colonial Horse, 1300
Native Infantry, and in all, with Military Train and
Hospital Staff, making 5700 men. It was found
impossible, for sanitary reasons, to form one undivided
column, and much as General Newdigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
objected to straggling, the exigencies of war compelled
him to send his forces off in detachments.
The King's Dragoon Guards marched on Monday,
the 26th, and these were followed by Harness's
Battery and a large convoy of stores on the following
day, Tuesday, the 27th. On the Wednesday the
headquarter staff took the road, accompanied by
the 17th Lancers, Le Grice's Field Battery, the
field-hospital, and the 24th Regiment. They took
with them fifteen days' supplies, and to accomplish
this General Newdigate wisely cut everything down
to the lowest possible limit, sixteen men being
allotted to each tent, and one tent only to six officers.
Tents were really superfluous; for the climate is
simply magnificent, and no man out on a shooting
expedition would dream of carrying about with him
such extra luxury as a bell-tent. Of course the
climate of this portion of Zululand being semi-tropical,
the usual precautions to be used in tropical
lands must be used here. The climate and diseases
which prevail along the line, from the Tugela, by
which Crealock was advancing, are thus alluded to
by Dr. Jones, district surgeon, one of the most experienced
authorities upon the subject. He says
that at a distance of fifteen miles from the sea the
fever is not more prevalent than in the interior;
that the high ground is comparatively safe in his
district, and that the type of fever is mild, the attack
lasting usually from five to twenty days. It begins
about February, and is always at its worst in March,
continuing more or less till the end of May, and
appearing to be more or less influenced by the
current of the north-east wind, which would, of
course, carry the miasma of the St. Lucia swamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in this direction. Dr. Dalzell, an equally good authority
as Dr. Jones, says that the high lands here are
remarkably healthy. The same holds good of the
tract known as Oham's country, situated in the valley
of the Black Umvolosi river. It is evident that
the fever of this country has been greatly exaggerated,
and that it is merely intensified in localities which are
within reach of the poisonous malaria borne upon the
wind. General Newdigate and General Crealock both
gave orders, that when the troops had to bivouac,
they were never on any account to pass the night
either on a very low or on a very wet situation, on
account of fever, or on the hill-tops, on account of
thunderstorms. The position of the Zulu kraals
should invariably be noted, and a lesson taken from
them in regard to choice of camp; while the neighbourhood
of a river that has been lately flooded
should, if possible, be always avoided. It is possible
that a white man settling here for good would
sooner or later be attacked by fever, but white men
do not settle here, while a rapid march through the
country appears to injure no one. Dysentery and
rheumatism troubled the troops but little, and cases
of sunstroke were rare. Sickness had prevailed
certainly to a considerable extent in some corps; but
it was, as a rule, confined to the young soldiers, unseasoned
and of weak physique, who had been lately
sent out from England. The cause of our failures&mdash;and
there were several of a palpable nature&mdash;are
not to be found in want of generalship, want of
organization, or want of transport. They were due
undoubtedly to the sending out of raw, sickly, unseasoned,
and untutored boys, who, being the sweepings
of half the regiments in her Majesty's service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
could not possibly have any feeling of communion,
or traditional sympathy, with the corps into which,
before a formidable enemy, they found themselves
pitchforked. Most of the battalions out there had
to draw their reinforcements not from its reserve
battalion or dep&ocirc;t at home, as was the case in former
years, but from the army at large, and some battalions
arrived on the shores of Africa so drenched
and diluted with outsiders, that they had the appearance
of a mongrel pack, unused to discipline and
useless in the field. That the destruction of the
regimental system by Lord Cardwell has been the original
cause of several of our reverses, surprises, and
humiliations, there can be little hesitation in saying.
The men at Isandhlwana were not well handled, it
must be admitted; but it has since leaked out that
many of them would not rally round their officers,
but attempted safety in flight. Dozens of the men,
sergeants and other non-commissioned officers, have
since declared they did not even know the names of
their company officers, or those of their right or left-hand
man.</p>

<p>Another instance of the evil effects of Lord
Cardwell's system may be given. The 91st recruits
in past days were the envy of all recruiting-sergeants,
and so particular was the colonel, backed up by the
surgeon of the corps, that a young fellow must have
had chest, constitution, and stamina&mdash;qualities unfortunately
not now insisted upon&mdash;before he could
pass the sacred portals of the 91st barrack. Few
regiments, however, have suffered from the present
system more than, or so much as, this corps. On
receiving its orders for Zululand, it could not muster
200 men, so denuded was the regiment of rank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
file by the drafts it had previously given. The
consequence was that to make up the 900 men which
was supposed to be its fighting strength, volunteers
and drafts had to be obtained from half the regiments
at home, and the facings of the 91st on
parade, until the master tailor had put matters a little
straight, represented almost all the colours of the
rainbow, while the men, drawn from all parts, neither
knew one another nor the officers set over them.</p>

<p>Rumours of negotiations for peace, and the
granting of an armistice, which were being circulated
about this time, arose from the following facts:&mdash;In
the middle of May Zulu messengers, of some
position, but not of the highest rank, had presented
themselves to General Crealock, with a desire to
know what terms would be granted to Cetywayo in
case of his wishing to come to terms of peace. The
General, finding they had no authority or commission
from the king, sent them away, but believing
from their statements that they were sincere, and
knowing at the same time that Setewango, one of
the king's most influential indunas, and Samapo and
Panato, the indunas who commanded against Pearson
at Ekowe, were in the neighbourhood of Ginghilovo,
let Setewango know that he would not object to see
him. Setewango admitted that he had no commission
or authority direct from the king, but added, at
the same time, that many of the chiefs were sick of
fighting, as they considered the English too strong.
General Crealock then said he had no power to treat,
but that Lord Chelmsford had, and if Cetywayo were
first seen by Setewango something might be arranged.
After this Setewango went to Ulundi, and
after great difficulty he and the indunas persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the king to allow them to visit Lord Chelmsford,
at whose camp they arrived early in June, having
first presented themselves to General Wood. Lord
Chelmsford saw these men three times, when they
were distinctly told that before any negotiations
could be entered into, as an evidence of the King's
sincerity the whole of the spoil taken at Isandhlwana,
especially the two captured 7-pounders, must be
restored. With these guns were to be sent accredited
ambassadors and hostages of the highest rank.
These Zulu messengers seemed much awed and
impressed with the appearance of the camp, and
particularly with Marshall's cavalry, and they left
on the 6th instant. They had not long departed
when much of their story was corroborated by Tongabena
and Lampunda, two well-known friendly
Zulu spies, who had just arrived from Ulundi, where
they assured us there were few warriors, the men
having declined to assemble. Dabulamanzi, whose
death has been so often reported, was still there, and
a large number of women, children, stores, and
cattle. Umbelini was really dead, having been three
times severely wounded, and was hit mortally in
the back through the blade-bone as he was escaping
on horseback.</p>

<p>On June 5th, Marshall had a very exciting little
brush with the Zulus not far from Wood's camp on
the Nondonini river. In this affair poor young
Frith, a capital soldier, a good adjutant, and a
general favourite, was unfortunately killed. He was
sitting on his horse receiving an order from Colonel
Drury-Lowe, when a Martini-Henry bullet struck
him, probably to the heart, as he never spoke. The
patrol was brought about by information brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
into Wood's camp by the ubiquitous and indefatigable
Buller, who had been out on the previous day
and discovered the whereabouts of a large Zulu
force. The gallant 17th and the smart King's
Dragoon Guards were delighted to see themselves in
orders on the afternoon of the 4th, that they were to
parade at four a.m. under General Marshall, who
was also to take with him Shepstone's Basutos and
Bettington's cavalry. It was not yet sunrise when
they arrived at Wood's camp on the Nondonini, and
then found that Buller, anxious to draw first blood,
had already started in the night to scour the country
and report what he could discover of the enemy.
After partaking of some excellent coffee, a little
beltong, and some well-made and well-baked bread
done in Wood's field-ovens, they were again in the
saddle, taking a course towards the south-east, till
the summit of a wild ridge overlooking a deep kloof
was reached. In the plain below was a pretty little
river, and near its bank a number of Kaffir huts all
blazing, having been fired early by Buller and his
men, who could be seen slowly retiring before a
number of Zulus, who were keeping up a hot fire
upon them, as well as from both sides of the valley.
The order was given to advance, and Buller soon
came on to meet them, making his report that he
had been attacked by these Zulus as soon as he
attempted to fire the kraal. Frith was the only
casualty, and the order was then given by General
Marshall to retire firing by alternate squadrons. As
the Zulus were posted in clefts and caves of the
ridges on either side, it was impossible to get at
them, and so the troops were brought steadily off
without further loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford had intended having a large
dep&ocirc;t formed on a portion of the Ibabanango
range; but owing to one of the principal staff
officers losing not only his own way, but his head,
his lordship was compelled to change the <i>venue</i>, and
form the principal dep&ocirc;t upon the Upoko river, not
far from the spot where the Prince met his fate.
This was called Fort Newdigate, and was held by
four companies of infantry, and a detachment or
two of cavalry to keep up communication with a
still more advanced dep&ocirc;t afterwards formed at
Umsenguini, near the source of the Upoko, where
the main road from Utrecht and the Transvaal
forms a junction with that leading through Rorke's
Drift and Isandhlwana.</p>

<p>How arduous were the duties of the cavalry in
convoying large trains of supplies from the bases to
the front through the enemy's country may be
surmised, when it is borne in mind that Lord
Chelmsford had to feed 7000 whites, 2000 natives,
350 English draught-horses, 850 saddle-horses, 2000
colonial horses and mules, and 10,634 oxen. From
these figures also may be formed an estimate of the
work thrown upon the Commissariat.</p>

<p>In previous wars out in South Africa blame has
been, and not unjustly, thrown upon the Commissariat
for the manner in which stores have been
wasted and frittered away while the troops have
been without rations. But in this war it would be
impossible to cite any such instance of want of
management, as the troops were invariably well fed
and cared for. Want of success, therefore, could in
no case be attributed to want of supply. Great
praise is due to Commissary-General Strickland for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the excellent manner in which all his plans were laid
and executed. Another instance of good work may
be given. On the 4th instant Lord Chelmsford had
occasion to send a sudden order to Commissary-General
Brownrigg for the immediate furnishing and
delivery of rations equal to six weeks' supply for
9000 Europeans, 2500 natives, 1200 English horses,
and 3000 cattle, and all these were sent in by
the 10th.</p>

<p>On June 10th Sir Evelyn Wood's column received
a valuable addition to its force; viz. 450 men of the
80th Regiment, all old and seasoned campaigners in
South Africa, together with four splendid Gatling
guns. On the same day a report was made that
Zulus had been seen near the Inyezani, and on the
following morning a patrol was sent out, consisting
of twenty Mounted Infantry, thirty Mounted Basutos,
and fifty Light Horse, under the command of
Captain Brown, who had with him Lord William
Beresford, and Captains Cochrane, D'Arcy, and
Berry. A reconnaissance for fully twenty miles
from the camp was made, and the patrol returned
about six the same evening, having made several
sketches and surveys of the country, but without
seeing any Zulus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile grumblers and incompetent critics had
kept so incessantly bringing all sorts of reckless
charges against Lord Chelmsford, of incapacity as a
soldier, that the home government thought it wise to
give way, and accordingly, to please the <i>vulgus profanum</i>,
recalled Sir Garnet Wolseley from Cyprus,
and appointed him Governor of South Africa, High
Commissioner in Natal and the Transvaal, and Commander-in-chief
of her Majesty's forces in Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
thus superseding Lord Chelmsford. This news
reached the troops actively employed against the
Zulus about the middle of June, and was received
with considerable dissatisfaction by both officers
and men. It seemed to them unfair that their
General should be superseded just as a final advance
was being made, and just as he was about to reap
the fruits of all his anxiety and labour. He had at
that time on the way to Ulundi a perfectly-equipped
force of 9364 Imperial Infantry, 3957 Colonial
Infantry, 1190 Imperial Cavalry, 1877 Colonial
Cavalry, 775 Artillery, with a proportionate number
of guns (36), and 385 Royal Engineers. Generals
Crealock and Newdigate had received full instructions
with regard to the concentration and movement
of this force, and all the organization had
been planned and carried out under the personal
supervision of Lord Chelmsford, who had worked
night and day to get matters to a state of efficiency.
It seemed, therefore, rather hard and disheartening
that the new General, who had had none of the
anxiety or the toil, should appear as the <i>Deus ex
machina</i> upon the scene, and reap all the credit and
glory of the campaign.</p>

<p>A great deal of rubbish was talked about the
inhumanity of burning down kraals, and accusations
of shooting down women and children were not
unfrequently brought against the troops. Now
most people in England do not know that there are
three distinct species of kraals. The king's or
royal kraals, the military kraals&mdash;i.e., the respective
barracks or official homes of the different corps&mdash;and,
finally, the tribal and domestic kraal, a sort of
village of cabins, built together for convenience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
safety. Now, Lord Chelmsford and all his lieutenants
were too good soldiers to allow England's
honour to be disgraced by wanton cruelty or barbarous
conduct even in fighting a barbarous enemy.
Military kraals, being the fortified dep&ocirc;ts of the
king's troops, their mustering rendezvous and
rallying-points, were attacked and destroyed without
compunction, as they represented the arsenals
and strongholds of the enemy. The king's royal
kraals, on the other hand, were the places where
Cetywayo got together cattle, mealies, and other
commissariat supplies, wherewith to tempt or
reward his warriors. These were destroyed as a
matter of course, as one would capture a convoy or
destroy a hostile magazine.</p>

<p>It has been stated on apparently good authority
that the destruction of a royal or military kraal
was considered by the Zulus as scarcely any loss,
and that the rebuilding of such was a matter of the
greatest ease. This is a totally erroneous view, as
all the kraals belonging to Cetywayo and his great
chiefs which had been destroyed were most formidable
as regards defence, and must have taken great
time and trouble to construct. All these kraals of
the kings, princes, and principal chiefs are protected
with high wooden stockades, pierced here and there
with low entrances, large enough to admit only one
person at a time. The isigodhlo, or inner enclosure,
where the chief huts are situated, is guarded by zigzags
of the same description of stockade work very
strongly put together. There are altogether about
forty military villages or kraals scattered through the
country, of from 400 to 3000 huts each, in which
for a portion of the year the troops are quartered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
averaging 2000 men in each. There are, however,
other military kraals not fortified, and used only as
barracks. These consist of a dry stake and wattle
fence, generally oval in form and about five feet
high. Inside this fence are the huts of the men in
single, double, or treble rows, according to the size
of the kraal, while inside the huts is another fence
similar to the one outside, and the central space is
invariably the cattle-pen. The king's kraal at
Ulundi (afterwards destroyed) was 800 yards in
diameter, and had a normal garrison of 5000 men.
The Umhlabatini plains, upon which it was situated,
are fifteen by twenty miles in extent, and completely
shut in by hills studded with thick bush. The White
Umvolosi runs through this plain, in which were
also established the other kraals forming the headquarters
of regiments. These, too, were subsequently
destroyed. Here in these kraals the principal
regiments were wont to assemble annually at
the great national military festival held in honour
of the king, which is now a tradition of the past.
Some years ago, when Cetywayo was full of ambition
in regard to his military power, and anxious in
every manner to consolidate it, he had a new magazine
or dep&ocirc;t of arms built at the junction of the
Black and White Umvolosi rivers. This magazine
and kraal is called Amanzekanze, and is surrounded
by a dense bush. The Amanzekanze kraal had, up
to this time, held the reputation of being impregnable,
and its approaches, it was said, were so
difficult that they could only be forced at immense
loss. The name of the kraal, Amanzekanze, translated
is "Let the enemy come now."</p>

<p>Coming now to the farming and domestic kraals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
it may without fear of contradiction be asserted,
after minute and careful inquiries, that no single
instance can be adduced in which her Majesty's
troops ever attacked or molested such unless first
attacked and fired upon.</p>

<p>A few words must here be said concerning the
helioscope, which on more than one occasion played
a prominent part in this war.</p>

<p>One of the great features of the occupation of Port
Durnford was the establishment of mirror-signals
from the "kop" at Port Durnford, and at the post
on the Inyezani down to the mouth of the Umlalasi.
The use of mirrors as a means of communication had
been so fully demonstrated in Afghanistan, that it
seemed astonishing that army officers at Natal were
supremely ignorant of, and, indeed, indifferent to,
the system. When it is remembered that by this
simple process it was found possible to flash intelligence
and words of sympathy and kindness to the
half-famished garrison at Ekowe, and that by means
of this admirable invention, many important items of
intelligence were from time to time instantaneously
and surely communicated from one part of the British
force to another, which through the position of the
enemy it was only possible to send by messengers,
who were compelled to take the most circuitous
routes, thus causing great delay and sometimes even
failing to reach their destination at all, the value of
this simple yet grand discovery cannot be too highly
considered.</p>

<p>Its importance in some respects may indeed be
declared to be in advance of the electric telegraph,
for that necessitates apparatus of delicate mechanism
and a friendly, or at least non-hostile territory, over
which the messages are sent. A predatory or hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
tribe may at any time sever the line of telegraphic
wire, and cut all communications between neighbouring
columns who are anxious to make their whereabouts
and intentions known; but this cannot be
done to the mirror system, where with no more
apparatus than a small hand-glass telegraphy is
established which no mortal agency can interrupt.
No invention, no discovery can surpass in value this
mode of silent yet eloquent communication, and only
the interruption of the sun's beams by clouds or fogs
can interfere with the transmission by signals,
noiselessly, and in a manner almost imperceptible to
all save the two interlocutors, who may be distant
ten, twenty, thirty, or even forty miles.</p>

<p>At Gibraltar messages are by this process constantly
sent across the Straits; and in Australia,
Mauritius, Singapore, and even Canada, the invention
has obtained for its discoverer the greatest reputation
and <i>kudos</i>.</p>

<p>Some four years ago Lieutenant Parrott, of the
Volunteer Engineer Corps of New South Wales,
conducted a series of very successful operations in
mirror telegraphy, using discs, about six inches in
diameter, of polished metal covered with glass. At
first the distance separating the two mirrors was
from six to ten miles, but eventually the system was
tested from the Kumagong mountain, about 2000
feet above the sea level, to the lighthouse at the
entrance to Port Jackson, 400 feet above sea level, a
direct distance of nearly forty miles. Now, when we
consider that the only apparatus required is a small
hand-mirror, and that no skill beyond the faculty of
reflecting the sun's beam in the required direction,
and of flashing "dots" and "signals" by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
a simple turn of the wrist, in the same way as the
Morse telegraph is presented by flag-signals, are
necessary, we must allow the vast importance of this
discovery to the soldier and the sailor, more especially
in savage or uncivilized warfare. Of course the
whole method is dependent on the presence of sunshine,
and, fortunately, Natal is seldom without this
great boon. In South Africa the sun's beams are
more constant than in almost any other clime, and
they may be counted and depended upon during
the major portion of the dry season. It is not
unworthy of notice that a system of sun-signalling,
not dissimilar to that established between
Port Durnford and General Crealock's column, has
been known and practised for some considerable
time among the Nez Perc&eacute;s Indians of North
America. Mr. F. C. Browne, of Sydney, Australia,
however, gives a still more remarkable method of
signalling, and states that successful feats have
also been accomplished by moonlight for distances
of from four to six miles. He considers, and doubtless
he is correct, that it would be quite possible to
supplement this sun-and-moon telegraphy on very
dark nights by an analogous system of alternately
obscuring and displaying at longer or shorter intervals
a powerfully reflected light.</p>

<p>Lately at Portsmouth some highly successful
experiments in night-signalling have been made by
casting the electric and other powerful lights upon
columns of steam; a method evidently suggested by
the helioscope and use of reflecting mirrors.</p>

camp&mdash;Lord Chelmsford's ultimatum to Cetywayo.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> actual advance of the 1st division may be said
to have commenced on the 17th of June, when the
gallant bluejackets and Marines (the Naval Brigade),
one troop of Lonsdale's Horse, and one troop of
Royal Engineers effected an important though short
movement from Fort Pearson, the so-called base, to
Fort Chelmsford; while the 57th Foot and Barton's
Contingent pushed on to Fort Crealock. General
Crealock, with his headquarters, arrived at Fort
Crealock on the following day, and on the 19th
reached Fort Chelmsford.</p>

<p>The road at starting from Fort Pearson led up a
steep ascent and across a table-land, gradually
sloping towards the west, with occasional slight
undulations, until it came to the steep and almost
cliff-like descent into the valley of the Amatikula.
Here frequent outcrops of sandstone and quartz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
were noticeable to the engineers, whose professional
enthusiasm was excited at seeing before them the
materials for building a permanent fort in the
district. Crystalline pebbles were plentiful, and the
soil, which was in some places of a reddish hue,
was at other points a pure white silver sand, both,
however, being covered by a considerable layer of
vegetable mould.</p>

<p>Many beautiful flowers gladdened the eye on the
march, amongst which were tiger lilies, convolvuli,
primulas of a rich deep yellow, and another species
having the appearance of a foxglove opened back.
In the valley of the Amatikula were some thorn-bushes
of osier-like growth, which the natives use
for fencing their kraals, and these bore large purple
bell-shaped flowers. On the coast grow some of a
similar nature, and a full mile further on were white
primulas, large yellow daisies, and small red and
blue flowers not unlike forget-me-nots. After this
came some rough marching, excessively trying to
the waggons and oxen, over very steep hills, through
patches of tiger-grass, and across ravines forty and
fifty feet deep, with almost precipitous sides, at each
of which it became necessary to unload the more
heavily-laden waggons and carry the contents up by
hand. All the hills were exceedingly rocky, being
composed mostly of granite, but in some instances
of nearly pure quartz, thickly clothed, however,
with trees whenever the inequalities of the ground
and surface allowed the soil to accumulate. The
greater number of these trees were acacias in full
bloom, their red, white, and yellow blossoms, and
those of other flowering trees standing out in rich
masses of gorgeous and Turneresque colour. Late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
in the afternoon the column arrived at the camping-ground
near Fort Crealock, where the works
were proceeding rapidly towards completion, and
every preparation was being made to reconnoitre
on to the Umlalasi. The laager was formed
above a rocky pass, having at the bottom pools
of water in splendid granite basins. Out of
these two small streams issued, one running west
and the other east, and falling ultimately into the
Umlalasi and the Umlatoosi. The next day a
patrol was sent out to explore a deserted kraal five
miles distant. Barrow, with about 100 horsemen,
also went out scouting; but after riding a couple
of miles found the hills so closed in on either side
and the path so blocked with bamboo cane grass
that his men were compelled to dismount and lead
their horses. The thick growth also shut out most
of the view of the hills, the prospect of which, however,
when a peep was obtainable, was delightful.
By the side of the path was a torrent bed more than
twenty feet deep, with nearly perpendicular sides,
and over this slope went one of Barrow's men,
horse and rider rolling over each other until the
stream below was reached, luckily without causing
any injury to the trooper&mdash;a Dutchman, whom
Barrow congratulated by telling him he suffered no
injury as he fell upon his head. A little hair rubbed
off a remarkably sun-browned forehead was all the
damage done, while the horse had only a few
scratches. The latter part of the pass, the same
afternoon, when the march was continued to Chelmsford,
was very slippery sandstone and quartz; and
at one point, where the waggons had to wind round
in single file, the hills, clothed to their summits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
with trees, rose to some 300 feet in height. These
heights were scouted as the troops advanced, but
nothing but old women and children were seen.</p>

<p>The valleys through which the column passed
were very fertile, with pleasing alternations of open
wood, jungle, grass, and cultivation. The torrents,
however, from the hills in the rainy season must do
great injury to the crops of mealies, and several
spruits and streams were crossed, flowing knee-deep
between thickets of bamboo and tall rushes, which,
when flooded, would have been impassable.</p>

<p>The second brigade was behind encamped on the
Inyezani, and included the Buffs, Naval Brigade,
88th, and Sandham's battery, and came on to
Chelmsford as the first brigade marched into camp
at Napoleon hill.</p>

<p>The two main causes of the seemingly protracted
delay in the advance of General Crealock's division
were want of transport beasts, among which a severe
epidemic had broken out, and the large amount of
fort-building and road-making requisite in and
around Port Durnford. Still, the time taken up in
regard to this new base was by no means wasted,
as it sufficed to keep a large and well-armed portion
of the Zulu army idle in this vicinity, and thus gave
Lord Chelmsford immense facilities for pushing on
his men to the left front, whilst General Crealock
was able to utilise his force towards the coast while
waiting for transport to move up into the interior.</p>

<p>The sick-list still continued somewhat heavy, a
very large proportion of officers and men being <i>hors
de combat</i>. Much of the malaria, the medical authorities
considered, arose from the effluvia caused by
the decomposition of the numerous carcases of oxen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and horses which lay all along the road, and literally
tainted and poisoned the air. These carcases lay
where the convoys had to pass, and the consequence
was that whenever a detachment had to come or go
to or from the fort, some portion, often a large percentage,
reported themselves ill with fever. The
remedy seemed easy, but was not so. The men
were worked so hard at digging and entrenching,
that it was impossible to detail fatigue parties to
bury or remove the carcases, which, therefore, were
left to breed pestilence in the camp.</p>

<p>On June 22nd General Crealock decided to make
another strong reconnaissance towards the sea on
the following day, and orders were given overnight
that the entire cavalry force, consisting of two
squadrons of mounted infantry, the Natal Horse, and
the native Basuto scouts, should parade at daybreak
with the whole of the 91st Highlanders. The
General's object was to utilise his stay at Fort
Napoleon by doing as much to open communications
with Port Durnford as possible, and particularly to
effect what improvements could be made in the
road between the fort and that place.</p>

<p>The only result of this expedition was that the
troops accidentally came upon a body of 250 Zulus,
driving away a large number of oxen; of which,
after a sharp skirmish, though without the loss of
a man, they captured 192 fine head, as well as
numerous women and children, who came to the
General imploring protection. This was of course
assured to them; and as they appeared hungry and
half starved, biscuits and mealies were served out to
them upon the ground. On the homeward march
to Fort Napoleon they were overtaken by two very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
good-looking young Zulus, fully armed and equipped
in war panoply. These men stated that they
belonged to Cuzame, a powerful Zulu chief, who
was now on his way with his wives and head men
to Fort Napoleon to surrender. On arriving at the
fort later on in the evening, this was found to be
the case. After a long interview with General
Crealock, in which Cuzame gave some valuable
information in regard to Cetywayo's army then
collecting for the defence of the big kraals, the
chief was ordered by the General to leave his
family and some of his warriors, and return to his
kraal for his arms and cattle. This he expressed
himself most willing and anxious to do.</p>

<p>It was now discovered that it was an error to
suppose that the Zulus were a united nation, all
regarding Cetywayo as their supreme autocrat and
head. On the contrary, there were other chieftains
with objects and ambitions of their own. Thus, a
chief named Umsintwanga (or the "Old Fox")
came in on the morning of June 26th, with the usual
ivory tusk and proposals for peace. He and his
party were seen at daybreak about two or three
miles from the camp trying to ford a small stream,
tributary to the Umlalazi. The vedettes could not
quite make out their proceedings, as, when halfway
across the stream, they turned back, ascended a
neighbouring kop, and spent a considerable time in
reconnoitring the position of the fort. This naturally
excited the suspicions of the patrol, to whom
the mounted vedettes reported, and a small mounted
body of men was sent to make a circuit and cut them
off in case they attempted to retire. Whether this
movement was observed is uncertain, but eventually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
after considerable delay, and after approaching the
camp from several different points, the chief and his
attendants, four in number only, came boldly up to
the patrol, and requested to be brought into camp,
to the presence of the great chief. At eight o'clock,
Umsintwanga, who is a rather finely built, elderly
man, inclined to be corpulent, was brought into the
presence of General Crealock, who treated him with
the greatest courtesy and respect. The countenance
of the chief showed a curious mixture of dogged
determination, savage cunning, and treachery. His
hair was frizzed, and plastered elaborately with red
clay and grease, while he wore a belt with some foxtails
round his waist, and a species of garters of
smaller tails tied below the knee. His mantle
seemed to be an old and much-stained horse-blanket,
and above this was a small tippet of leopard-skin,
worn something like a herald's tabard. He carried
no weapon save a stout knobkerrie, and his attendants,
who were four splendidly stalwart Zulus,
carried the tusk with the greatest ease and dignity.
Care had been taken that the place of conference
should be out of sight of the fort, and for this purpose
the base of a small hollow near the camp had been
chosen, where the rising ground intervened and prevented
any observation of what was going on in the
trenches and about the lines. The conference was
not of long duration, for after waiting a reasonable
time to allow the chief time to collect himself, the
general at once and shortly asked what was the
meaning and purport of his mission, and why
he had come into camp. To this Umsintwanga,
through an interpreter, replied that he was sent by
the king and his indunas to sue for peace, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
proof of their overtures being sincere he desired to
present the immemorial symbol of peace and friendship,
the ivory tusk. He said further, that he was
deputed to ask the stoppage of the 1st Division, the
proceedings of which had much grieved and astonished
the king, and he, therefore, was desired to ask
that it should advance no further towards the king's
kraal, while he, the ambassador, might be allowed to
go through our division to Natal. Umsintwanga
spoke tolerably well, and seemed not to have learnt
his speech off by heart, as he occasionally hesitated,
stopped, and now and then exchanged words and
phrases for others which he thought more suitable.
General Crealock, who listened with the utmost
deference and patience to the somewhat long tirade,
then rather abruptly said, "Am I to understand
you distinctly, and without any reservation, that
you, Umsintwanga, induna, come direct and with
full authority from the king?" This query seemed
to astonish and somewhat confuse the ambassador,
who, after some little circumlocution, admitted that
he had come, if not quite with the king's authority,
at least with his knowledge and sanction. On being
pressed a little more, the old chief further admitted
that it was principally by the desire of the indunas,
more than by that of the king, that he had come,
and he still most positively adhered to the statement
that his proposals were official and in good faith.
Umsintwanga was then informed that he had not
come to the proper camp with his proposals, that it
was to Lord Chelmsford, and no other, that he must
apply, and that even if he went to Lord Chelmsford
he would not be listened to unless the demands
specified in his lordship's ultimatum were complied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
with to the letter. The whole of the interview did
not occupy more than a quarter of an hour or twenty
minutes; and when it was over, it would have been
quite impossible to have told, from the imperturbable
countenances of the induna and his suite,
whether they were disappointed or not. They
seemed to take their rebuff as if they expected it,
and were then conducted by a circuitous route away
from our camp, and left, with the tusk, two miles
upon their road.</p>

<p>It must here be remarked that Lord Chelmsford
had throughout the campaign shown the greatest
suavity and patience to any attempt at peaceful
proposals, but he had by this time seen the necessity
of a certain degree of firmness, and General Crealock,
although he doubtless would have given a
similar answer had he not been instructed, had a
complete understanding with the Commander-in-chief
that no proposals were to be listened to unless
accompanied with the fulfilment of the conditions
laid down in the chief's message to the last messengers.
Brigadiers Bray and Rowlands, together
with the whole of the General's staff, were present
at the interview, and the induna and his attendants,
although unwilling to manifest any surprise, were
evidently impressed with the quietude and promptitude
with which every wish and order of the General
were carried out. Again on June 21st, General Crealock,
then engaged in completing the fortifications
at Napoleon hill, rode out across the Umlalazi river
with a small staff and escort, to interview a chief
named Umguelumgwizi, who had just made friendly
overtures and expressed a wish to consult the
General as to what his future line of conduct should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
be. Umguelumgwizi's kraal was some miles off, but
the chief said he would come and meet the General;
and not more than two miles in his direction had
been traversed when he was seen coming, accompanied
by several of his sons and head men. The
Zulu chief was known to be rich in cattle, and possessed
of considerable local influence. He was a
man apparently about fifty-two or fifty-three years
of age, and, in spite of a somewhat sinister expression,
had a tolerably open and apparently honest
manner of speaking. He was not by any means
long in coming to the point, declaring emphatically
that he had no quarrel with the English, or, for the
matter of that, he added, with the Dutch. He had
heard of and understood the award given by the
English Commissioners in regard to the Dutch
boundary, and he thought "Sompsen" and "Bartle"
had behaved most generously to Cetywayo. He had
been obliged to go out to fight on Cetywayo's side,
but neither he nor his young men wished to go out
again. If he refused, he would be accused of witchcraft,
"smelt out" and "eaten out." What was
he under these circumstances to do? General Crealock,
who had listened very patiently to this somewhat
long harangue, said he had spoken honestly
and well, that as a soldier he did not wish to advise
any man to desert his king or his chief, but that he
could not be doing wrong in refusing to fight in
what he considered an unjust cause. If he chose
to come in and surrender, with his arms, his cattle,
his wives, children, and his tribe, all should be protected,
and all should be held for him in trust till peace
was made. The chief, who seemed much pleased with
General Crealock's kind and manly advice, consulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
a few moments with those of his advisers who were
with him, and then asked the General to give him one
day for consideration. "Willingly, my friends," said
Crealock, "and I will meet you on this side of the
river to-morrow, when you can tell me your decision."
Upon the Monday (June 22nd), therefore, directly
after the General had made his usual tour of inspection
among the road fatigues, he crossed over,
this time with a couple of troops of Barrow's men,
and met Umguelumgwizi with an immense following,
consisting of his wives and children. The General,
however, explained to the chief that he could only
accept this surrender in part, and that it would not
be complete until all his cattle and all his fighting
men came in. This the chief promised to attend to.</p>

<p>On the 25th the 1st Brigade, under General Rowlands,
crossed and moved down the river, encamping
about six miles from here. The day following this
brigade moved on to Port Durnford, and reinforced
the small force there. On the 27th Clarke's Brigade
started from this place, and moved on to support
Rowlands', encamping and laagering up two hills in
sight of the 1st Brigade. From this encampment
a splendid view of Fort Durnford can be obtained.</p>

<p>The long ranges of mountains, which completely
separate the coast-line from the interior, here stand
out in magnificent relief, and although they are at a
distance of fifty to seventy miles, they present
a sharply defined outline in the morning air, their
ravines, watercourses, and terraced heights appearing
with almost supernatural distinctness. Here is
a country where the light is rich and brilliant, where
the atmosphere is surpassingly bright and clear, and
the scenery bold, spacious, and grand. The characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
beauty of light in South Africa is not seen
in its blending with manifold forms of cloud so much
as in the full and even splendour with which it penetrates
the air. Distant objects, that in a less brilliant
atmosphere fade away in hazy outline, stand out
with perfect distinctness. Let a spectator place
himself at a distance of twenty or thirty miles from
the Drakenberg, or any of the big ranges of this
country, and contrast the effect he will obtain with
that he would experience with Snowdon, Mangerton,
or any of our home mountains at a similar distance.
Small boulders, cavernous hollows in the rocks,
patches of bush at the head of the kloofs, at an elevation
of 2000 or 3000 feet, are seen with the naked
eye without difficulty. A northern mountain at
home, at either of these elevations, will appear in
more or less of hazy outline with all details of face
and profile obscured, but here in the clear atmosphere
of Zululand, the very direction of the watercourses,
the curves of the kloofs, and, indeed, every
bold wrinkle on the face of the slopes of the mountains
can be most clearly discerned.</p>

<p>We must now leave Crealock building his forts
and making his roads, while we turn our attention to
the movements of Newdigate and Wood.</p>

<p>Every facility had been given to Crealock's (1st)
Division to make the first forward movement on the
king's kraal. Lord Chelmsford considering that
after the difficulties General Crealock had encountered
it would be only fair to him and to those under
his command to give him every chance of winning
first blood in the final attack. However, the coast
sickness proved so fatal to Crealock's transport
train that he was utterly unable to take advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of Lord Chelmsford's generosity, and it was to the
2nd column that the final honours of Ulundi fell.
On Saturday, the 21st inst., General Newdigate with
this column reached the right bank of the Umlatoosi,
while Evelyn Wood, with his strong flying column,
had slightly preceded him, and had encamped a little
lower down on the left bank. Newdigate's brigadiers
were Glynn and Collingwood, with Marshall in command
of the cavalry; and his corps were two
batteries of artillery and an ammunition column, the
2nd company of Engineers, the King's Dragoon
Guards and 17th Lancers, the 21st, the 1-24th,
58th, and 94th Regiments, Shepstone's Horse, No.
3 Troop, and the Mounted Natives. This force
made up 1870 Europeans, 530 Natives, and eight
guns. Wood's field state of this date gave the
Gatling Battery, the Engineers, the 13th, 90th, and
a wing of the 80th Regiment, with Buller's Cavalry,
consisting of the Mounted Infantry, Frontier Light
Horse, Transvaal Rangers, and Wood's Irregulars,
making a force of 2192 Europeans, and 573 Natives,
four guns and two Gatlings. These two columns,
therefore, gave Lord Chelmsford a compact and
admirably-welded and homogeneous body of 4062
Europeans, 1103 Natives, 12 guns, and two Gatlings,
and with this force he justly considered that
he held Ulundi in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>On the day following (the 22nd), while Newdigate,
whose oxen much required it, gave the division a
holiday in camp, Wood pushed on about four miles,
taking care to note every bush, rock, stream, and
salient point <i>en route</i>. The march was through a
mixture of jungle, long grass, and occasional outcrops
of granite, mixed with unpleasant-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
boulders of grey sandstone, but which would have
been well appreciated by an engineer for the construction
of a permanent work of defence. Ten
small streams were passed, besides tributaries of the
Umvolosi, and many tracks of buffalo and elephant
were seen, while some of Wood's enthusiastic
sportsmen were positive they could at times hear the
well-known trumpet of the latter in the jungle. The
road then led along a narrow valley, flanked by
rocky hills on either side. On the banks of the
stream which flowed in this spot some deserted kraals
were seen, with broken utensils, stone fireplaces,
and small pits where mealies were stored and still
left. The huts which composed these kraals were
not built in the same way as others they had seen,
but seemed constructed with more skill and an
eye to greater comfort. First of all were stout
posts planted in the ground, and the interstices filled
up with clay. The roof, instead of being of the
general umbrella shape, was flat, and with a slight
slope to the front; and the rafters were covered
either with sheets of bark or with bushes and grass,
over which was spread a thick coating of earth.
Sweet potatoes, cut in slices, pumpkins and gourds,
and other vegetables of a succulent nature, were laid
on some of the roofs to dry for the winter's provision.
The interior of these huts had, instead of one,
as is usual in Zululand, two, and sometimes three
divisions. The first contained a small raised space
for a bed-place, covered with hides, and here was
the almost universal African fireplace, consisting of
the three cones of clay, which in many instances are
hollow, and form a most ingenious oven. The only
cooking utensils were earthen pots, nearly everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
in this part of South Africa being prepared
for eating by boiling. In the next division lambs
and goats were kept, and the innermost one was
used as a granary, where corn is stored in "lindo,"
band-boxes made of bark, with the lids carefully
luted on with clay. These lindo are sometimes of
enormous size, and are sufficiently large to contain
a dozen or more sacks. Light is admitted only
through the one door, which also provides the sole
means for the escape of smoke, and as a consequence
the rafters and walls are black and shiny, and the
cobwebs with which they are festooned are loaded
with soot. Among the rafters walking-staves, and
knobkerries, assegais, and other primitive weapons of
war, are usually stored, so as to get them good and
due seasoning by the smoke. The largest of the
villages was clean and surprisingly well-built, said
to be after a model one made by the late King
Panda. It was surrounded by a stockade, in
addition to the outer walls of houses, and the part
where the chief had evidently lived was divided off
from the rest of the village, and was also the gateway.
The gates were heavy slabs of wood, hewn
out of the solid trunk, and those wanting to enter
could only go up to the principal gate one at a time,
as a wing of palisading projected on either side in
the form of a long U, with holes to use assegais
through, so that it would be no pleasant attempt to
try to force an entrance against the will of the dwellers
therein. There were some other smaller doorways
in the outer walls of the house, forming part of
what might be termed the <i>enceinte</i>, which closed in
a sort of portcullis fashion. A number of heavy
logs had holes in their upper ends, and the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
plate was rove through them. When the doorway
is open, these logs are triced up inwards and out of
the way, and when closed the outer sides of the
lower ends butt, as it were, against a strong fixed
log, and are secured by a strong movable log inside.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, Brigadier-General Wood halted, still
on the left bank of the Umlatoosi, for the purpose of
building a fort, which was to be held by two companies
of the 58th, two of Harness's field-guns, and some
irregular cavalry. The outlines and profiles were
soon traced by experienced though not professional
engineers, and on the evening of the same day the
place was securely defensible.</p>

<p>The spot chosen by Wood to build the fort is on the
Umlatoosi, and in a position naturally of great
strength, for the river there makes a rapid bend and
affords a ready means of both banks being swept
and commanded from the work. A rude and most
insecure bridge, formed of a couple of huge trees,
already existed, but this was now under water, while
the strength of the current was so great when the
survey was being made that several of Wood's men
were washed off, and only saved themselves by
catching at bushes on the bank. In the centre of
the stream there is an island, and upon this an
outwork was constructed. This island is situated
amongst numerous rapids and cascades, breaking
out from the rocky hillside. The difficulties of
getting across seemed at first sight almost insuperable,
but after a time it was discovered that there
were places where it was possible to jump from rock
to rock, and then to wade through the rapids themselves
on narrow shelves, holding meanwhile "like
grim death" by ropes of creepers, stretched from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
side to side for that purpose. It will be, of course,
understood that a single false step, or the snapping
of the creeper-rope, at these points would be fatal,
for nothing could save the traveller in that case
from being dashed to pieces amongst the rocks
beneath. The stream below this was about fifty
yards wide, very deep, and running like a sluice.
Happily a passage was effected without any casualty.
Looking back from the other side a most striking
sight is presented by this mass of water bursting
out of the precipitous hillside, and broken by the
rocks and little bushy islands into foaming cascades.
Many small streams are passed, which occasionally
flow for some considerable distance in subterranean
channels. They work in amongst loose stones,
covered with soil and vegetation, the underground
portions of their course being sometimes not more
than forty yards of their length, while in other
instances they seem to have disappeared altogether,
and no doubt help to supply those mysterious fresh
springs which are known to exist even on the beach
at Port Durnford.</p>

<p>The eastern portion of the Umlatoosi district, and
that leading to the sea is moderately level, with
rocky hills, on the summits of which are situated
the villages of the chiefs; but as the western portion
is reached, the country breaks into mountains of
every shape and form, amongst which the more
numerous are needles and cones of granite. In the
foreground the hills are of red sandstone, crowned
with groves of magnificent trees, festooned with
jasmine and other sweet-scented creepers. Many
of the rivers appear to have been crossed in former
days by bridges, constructed either by the Zulus or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
by the missionaries, or possibly by both. Poles were
planted in the bed of the stream, and upon others
lashed at the top smaller poles and branches were
laid to form the footway. When first constructed
these were doubtless secured to the cross-pieces by
lashings, but by this time they had rotted away,
and consequently afforded but a very precarious
foothold.</p>

<p>Between the 24th and the 26th both columns&mdash;that
is to say, the headquarters and Wood's&mdash;advanced
but six miles, but Buller was not more
idle than Wood, as, while the latter was building a
fort to hold a couple of hundred men in the heart
almost of a formidable enemy's country, the former
had patrolled in almost every direction to the front,
rear, and both flanks. On the 25th Buller and his
"merry men" were in the saddle and away more
than nine miles to the front, and by noon there came
an orderly, "bloody with sparring, fiery red with
haste," who brought news that "Redvers," with his
usual good fortune, had pounced upon about seventy
or eighty Zulus busily engaged in grass-burning, to
bother the advance in regard to grass for the horses
and oxen. Buller made extremely short work of
these fellows, whose surprise was so complete that
the whole lot might have been annihilated if humanitarian
principles had not interposed. As soon as
the grass was effectually saved, Buller proceeded on
a few miles, and, although watched here and there,
suffered not the slightest molestation. The same
evening (25th) Buller came back from his own camp
to the headquarter camp with full information in
regard to the five kraals that had been observed on
the 24th in the district of Usipexi, which he reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
were guarded by a tolerably formidable Zulu impi.
A small and select council of war was at once held
in General Newdigate's tent, under the presidency
of the Commander-in-chief. After a very short
conference, in which Lord Chelmsford, Generals
Newdigate and Marshall, and Colonels Drury-Lowe
and Buller were the principal speakers, it was
finally decided that an attack in force should be
made upon the five kraals, and any others that could
be discovered at an early hour on the following
day. At daybreak accordingly the force was drawn
up in line for Lord Chelmsford's inspection, which,
as was usual with him, was, though rapid, most
carefully minute. On the right were two guns
and fifty men of Le Grice's admirable battery, and
next came two of Drury-Lowe's splendid blue-and-white
squadrons. These fellows would have
won the heart of any light cavalry colonel or
adjutant, and it seemed almost a pity that such
glittering panoply of crest and spear and plume
should have to abide the thrust of a hidden assegai
from behind a rock or bush. Four hundred and
fifty of Buller's best men, though not so smart
nor so well mounted as Drury-Lowe's gallant
fellows, were not despised or looked down upon
by those who were present, and the more brilliantly
decked trooper, with his uniform and
glittering <i>apanage</i>, felt proud to ride with the
men who had fought so well at Zlobani and conquered
so grandly at Kambula. Two companies
of natives made up the force, which perhaps was
the largest patrol ever furnished in this war for
such a duty as the burning of kraals. The guns
and part of the cavalry were sent by a circuitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
path which led to an eminence near the largest
kraal, and part of Buller's Horse bearing a little
to the right, the main body advanced along the road
by which Buller had yesterday returned. They first
came to the large kraals of Udugwoosu and of
Udlumbedlu, which were found deserted, and shelled
and burnt without opposition; and when this was
effected, the cavalry and natives descended into the
plains, to Uxixipi, which was also destroyed, after
shelling out about a thousand natives, who were at
once pursued by the Basutos and Frontier Light
Horse. Not many Zulus were killed, as some were
old men and boys, and strict orders had been
given to spare these.</p>

<p>On the 27th the flying column, under Wood,
advanced nine miles on the road to Ulundi; while
the main division, under Newdigate, with Brigadiers
Glynn and Collingwood, and Marshall in command
of the cavalry, moved on eleven miles, both
columns encamping at a place called Amhlabatini,
within a mile of each other. They carried no
tents, but took with them 200 ammunition-waggons,
and ten days' full rations, which on emergency
could have been spun out to double that
number. Soon after the halt all the brigadiers
were assembled by Lord Chelmsford, who briefly
but succinctly expounded to them his intentions
and future action. His lordship said the time had
now arrived for a final blow to be dealt, and he
purposed, having first established a base of operations
by constructing a small dep&ocirc;t laager at
Amhlabatini, pushing on at once to the attack of
Ulundi. Buller would clear the front and mask
the columns as they advanced, and would do all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
he could to provoke and entice the enemy to
attack in the open. The question now was what
details were to be left at the laager as a garrison,
and it was decided that these should be furnished
by three companies of the 1-24th Regiment, and
some other contingents, making up 500 men.
Soldiers, as a rule, must accept all commands without
question; but although no open word is spoken,
there are times when the bitterness of disappointment
will show itself without speaking. Such was
the case when the order-book proclaimed the duty
detailed for the 24th.</p>

<p>The entrenched laager was most artistically made
in an incredibly short space of time. Within a
radius of 500 yards all trees and bush were cut down
and cleared away. In the centre a rectangle of
waggons was formed, with earth thrown up above
the axletrees, and at 15 yards' distance from these a
trench and an embankment three feet high were constructed.
Again, about 100 yards beyond this,
strong and well made abattis were placed. These
consisted of whole trees and stout branches 12 and
15 feet long, felled and placed side by side, with
their butts inwards and boughs interlaced, while the
twigs and small leaves were stripped off and the
boughs sharply pointed. The butts were strongly
picketed down, and in some cases fastened by logs
laid across several butts. These abattis were fully
five feet in height, and as green wood&mdash;not easy to
burn&mdash;was selected, they made a formidable obstacle.
It took 200 men only eight hours to construct 200
yards of abattis, and this, considering that many of
them had never done such work before, was most
creditable. All the officers were in the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
possible spirits, and no inconsiderable amount of
banter was carried on between the two columns
during the visits paid from one to the other. One
of the most fertile subjects for "chaff" was the
increasing weight and sleekness of Buller's men as
compared with the visibly apparent attenuation of
their horses, and the joke was to affect to believe
that these "African Cossacks," as they were called,
devoured all the oxen they captured, while making
their horse-rations into oatmeal cakes for themselves!
This story, if <i>ben trovato</i>, was singularly
devoid of fact, for Buller's horses presented a most
favourable contrast to those of Marshall, as the
former would eat almost anything, and the latter
were only just commencing to put up with mealies.
The constant work of the former animals had
naturally kept them devoid of superfluous flesh, but,
for all this, they were as hard as "nails" and good
in their wind.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 27th, vedettes signalled
the approach of some natives, accompanied
by a large number of cattle. These proved to be
further messengers from Cetywayo, bringing 150 of
our oxen captured at Isandhlwana, together with a
pair of elephants' tusks and a letter, written in
English by a captive dealer. The letter was fairly
expressed, and said that the king could not comply
with all Lord Chelmsford's demands, as the arms
taken from us at Isandhlwana were not brought to
him, and that it was beyond his power as a king to
order or compel any of his regiments to lay down
their arms. The letter also said that Harness's
guns should be sent, and on receipt of the cattle and
these weapons the English must retire from Zulu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
territory. Whoever had written the letter must
have been a bold and plucky fellow, as he had added
in a corner in pencil a few words of warning, and an
intimation that Cetywayo had with him at Ulundi
and the neighbouring kraals a large and picked impi,
amounting to 20,000 men. Even without this message
Lord Chelmsford would have considered these
overtures as suspicious; but, as it was, increased precaution
against surprise or treachery was taken.
Lord Chelmsford accordingly declined the tusks,
and told the messengers in the plainest language
that, before he thought of retiring, all the original
conditions must be complied with, more especially
as regards the formal laying down of arms by the
regiment. The messengers were then escorted from
our column, and later in the day several large bodies
of Zulus, amounting to some thousands, were noticed
moving in a lateral direction from the side of Ulundi,
and passing along by the left flank. The following
day was a busy one for all. Lord Chelmsford was
so anxious to complete the main details of the dep&ocirc;t
laager that he deferred his march till sundown.
Wood, however, moved on in the morning as far as
the left bank of the White Umvolosi, where he
bivouacked and waited for the main body. After
waiting until all the more prominent and essential
matters were completed in regard to the garrison
left in the dep&ocirc;t, Lord Chelmsford ordered the
parade for 5.30 in the evening, and they then
marched on to the next bivouac in a compact and
well-organized column. It was still daylight when
the White Umvolosi was reached, and they saw
across the river, on the left bank, the flying column
and the Lancers already bivouacked. The scene as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
on the right bank of the river was most picturesque.
On the left bank of the Umvolosi Wood had admirably
chosen the ground for his bivouac. Here
was a firm, wide plateau, bounded on the east and
north by a hilly country, broken up by knolls and
tall cone-like eminences, whose slopes here and there
were covered by patches of dense jungle or bordered
by young forests, whose shades seemed to invite
shelter during the fierce heat of the day. Away in
the extreme distance the landscape differed materially
in aspect from the country near. Mountains of
loftier altitude, rising peak upon peak, tier upon
tier, and range upon range, met the eye everywhere.
Green trees covered their slopes in apparently endless
expanse of vegetation. Immediately behind the
Lancer camp, and sheltering it from the night
breezes that swept across the plain, was a massive
buttress of rock covered with richly and delicately-hued
velvety mosses, while down the hard, steep,
rocky beds of granite and sandstone, with here and
there basalt and porphyry, flint and quartz, foamed
sparkling little streams, which always seem so
refreshing and so tempting on a South African
march. A deep gaping fissure in a high jutting
wall of rock, through which bubbled the clear water
in volumes; a great towering rock with perpendicular
walls, to which clung, in spite of apparent impossibility,
ferns and plants and moss, thick and
velvety; and a huge conical hill which ambitiously
hid its head in the clouds; these were wild and
rugged forms of nature to be treasured up long after
their marching days were gone and past. The camp
was situated on a wide terrace or shelf of ground
rising above a body of water, which more resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
a long narrow lake than a river. This part of the
White Umvolosi, indeed, like many other African
rivers, loses its current in the dry season, and
becomes a series of long narrow pools, which in
some places may be compared to lakes for their
length, according to the nature of the ground in
which depressions are found. If the ground is
rocky or of clayey mud the water is retained, instead
of being absorbed, and here swarm multitudes of
silurus, or bearded mud-fish. Wherever mud-fish
are abundant, crocodiles, the great fish-eating reptiles
of the African waters, are sure to be found, and,
singularly enough, wherever crocodiles are found one
is almost sure to find the hippopotamus&mdash;not because
crocodiles and hippopotami have any affinity for
each other, but because the soil which retains the
water during the hot days of the drought season is
almost sure to produce in the vicinity of the pools
abundance of rich grass and tall cane, the favourite
food of the hippopotamus. Two miles further in
the plain Wood's bivouac fires were seen in glittering
and regular ranks, marking out the exact ground
which each regiment or corps would occupy in order
of parade or march. Far away, but in a line with
each angle of the bivouac, were the outlying pickets;
while, again, beyond these were those vigilant and
unsleeping patrols which made this column so
secure and impossible to surprise.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 29th the main body crossed
the river and joined the flying column on the left
bank. They now were but fifteen miles from Ulundi,
and all the king's kraals were visible to the naked
eye. On the far slope of the hills that bound the
plain were the two round kraals, Likasi and Undabakawazi;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
next, and built in the shape of a crescent,
were Unodwengo, Panda's old palace, Ulundi, built
by the present king, while farthest of all was another,
making five, called Umpanibougwena.</p>

<p>On the 30th Lord Chelmsford was ten miles
from the Umvolosi; and he sent a despatch to Sir
Garnet Wolseley, to say that the king's messengers
had just left with an ultimatum for Cetywayo, to the
effect that his lordship must advance to a position
on the left bank of the river on the 1st July, but
that if no opposition were offered the troops would
wait there without any hostile movement until twelve
at noon on the 3rd, when, if the original terms
sent to Cetywayo, namely, the delivery of the guns
taken at Isandhlwana, and the cattle, were complied
with, 1000 captured rifles would be received instead
of a regiment laying down its arms, and peace negotiations
would be entertained. On the following
morning, accordingly, the main body marched at an
early hour, and, preceded by the flying column and
Buller's men scouring the country in front and flank,
arrived at the river and took up the position named
above.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the 3rd of July, the last
day of grace, so far from any compliance with
Lord Chelmsford's demands being made, all sorts
of hostile demonstrations were shown by the Zulus,
who were gathered in large numbers about eight
miles off. All day long, on the 1st and 2nd,
there had been a dropping fire at long ranges
upon our men; and on the 3rd the enemy, growing
bolder, pushed his skirmishers down to some rocks
on the opposite side of the river, and fired upon the
men as they were watering their horses in the
stream. One horse was killed and several men
wounded, and then it was that Buller asked
and obtained permission to make a raid into the
enemy's country.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon Buller was waiting impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
to cross, looking, as was said of Picton, "in
a heavenly humour, because some one was likely to
be killed." A couple of guns were brought into
position on the banks of the river, to cover Buller's
crossing, and, if necessary, to assist his retreat if
hard pressed on his return. A couple or three
rounds of shrapnel made short work of a crowd of
Zulus who had approached on the opposite height
in a most impudent manner; and hardly were the
echoes of these heard along the shores before Buller
and Beresford, dashing into the stream with a cheer
that made the rocks resound, were followed over the
river by Buller's horsemen, the Mounted Infantry,
and Baker's Horse. A good billiard or racquet
player likes a gallery, and if the very dashing rifleman
and <i>beau sabreur</i> were at all anxious for an
audience, they certainly had a large one on this
occasion. In fact the whole camp&mdash;if camp you
can call a bivouac without tents&mdash;turned out literally
in its shirt-sleeves to see the fun. The fatigue
parties stopped their wood-cutting to take a look at
the two camp favourites as they raced like school-boys
at a paper hunt after the Zulus, who were
scuttling away like prize pedestrians to gain the
shelter of a friendly kraal. Buller being in command,
however, was not forgetful of his men; and,
though galloping at a steeplechase pace, kept them
well in hand, and raced with about a score of his
fellows at the military kraal Dalwayo, on our right
front. Beresford, however, being a sort of chartered
libertine, and having no separate command, "went
for" the Zulus entirely, as he subsequently expressed
it, "on his own hook." Meanwhile, by Buller's
order, Baker's men, guided by their leader, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
inclined to the left front, to carry and hold a favourable
hillock which commanded the best part of the
ford. This piece of thoughtful strategy proved
invaluable at the close of the day, when the horsemen
had hard work to get back. On galloped
Buller's men past Nodwengo, Lord William well to
the front, now sabring a Zulu, now stopping to aid
a wounded comrade; while Buller, having picked a
hundred of his best-mounted men, pushed on with
the intention of exploring and, if possible, firing
Ulundi.</p>

<p>There was nothing impossible in this project.
Buller had good information that the bulk of the
king's army was away upon Lord Chelmsford's
right flank, and that the kraal would possibly have
a slender guard. It was well, perhaps, that this
somewhat hairbrained exploit should not be carried
out, and it was stopped as follows:&mdash;The contour of
the ground between this point and the king's kraal
was formed by a succession of undulating (at rather
a steep angle) plains, which in the hollows gave
admirable cover and concealment to the Zulus.
These large dongas in two places formed positions
where bodies of men could be massed at right
angles, and so take an incautious enemy on the
flank. Here the Zulu general, whoever he was, had
admirably disposed his reserves, and here, but for
the steady conduct of all hands, Buller might have
met his fate. As suddenly as the mountain warriors
of Roderick appeared above the heather to James
Fitz-James, did the tall Zulu warriors put in an
appearance, and from front and flank a very well
sustained fire was poured in upon the daring Buller
and his men. But Buller, with all the dash of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Rupert or a Murat, had much of the prescience and
caution of a veteran, and invariably adopted the
principle which may be indifferently expressed as
"having two strings to your bow," or "not having
all your eggs in one basket." He had, previously
to his daring advance in the enemy's country,
ordered Commandant Raaf to halt near Nodwengo,
with his horsemen as reserve and supports. At the
imminent moment, therefore, when the Zulus
appeared in the hollows, these gallant fellows came
up and saved the day, and it is more than probable
many valuable lives. As Buller and his splendid
marksmen retired by alternate ranks, and as
each man fired, dropping his man, Raaf and his well-trained
fellows covered the slow retreat; Baker's
Horse also held the hillock of which mention has
been before made, and did excellent service by the
manner in which the Zulus were held in check.
Tremlett's little battery on the right front of the
camp kept back the enemy on the left line of retreat,
so that the raid into the enemy's country, although
not productive of any palpable advantage as regards
booty or prisoners, was eminently well carried out
as a reconnaissance in force. The Zulus were
exceedingly well led, and it was impossible not to
admire their admirable skirmishing, and the magnificent
manner in which they charged right down to
the river's edge, amidst a storm of grape and shrapnel
hurled against them to cover the retreat. Buller,
of course, was wherever hard knocks were most to
be obtained, while Beresford distinguished himself
as much by his capital horsemanship, daring valour,
and perfect coolness, as by the noble chivalry with
which he galloped, under a heavy hostile fire, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
bring off, on his tired and overweighted horse, a
wounded sergeant of the Mounted Infantry.</p>

<p>It happened thus:&mdash;Just after the volley had
been poured in by the Zulus on either flank, Lord
William Beresford, who had literally cut his way
through about fifty Zulus who had tried to surround
him, turned in the saddle to see how his men were
getting on, and saw upon the ground a dismounted
and wounded trooper about to be assegaied by half-a-dozen
Zulus. Wheeling his horse round like
lightning, he swept like a thunderbolt on the group,
knocking three of the savages over with his horse's
shoulder, and placing the other three <i>hors de combat</i>
with a front and back-hander of his long, heavy
sabre. In another moment Beresford had the
wounded man safely <i>en croupe</i>, and carried off from
what would have been a cruel death. Commandant
D'Arcy, with equal gallantry, was not so fortunate,
for seeing a wounded man on the ground he sought
to carry him off, but his horse, being restive, reared
and fell back, so that the unfortunate trooper was
overtaken and assegaied, while D'Arcy was so
severely bruised by falling on his revolver, that,
although able to get back safely, he was unable to
take part in the next day's fight. Three men killed,
four wounded, and thirteen horses killed, was the
total loss to our men.</p>

<p>A little before daybreak on the 4th, Wood, with
his flying column, crossed the White Umvolosi,
leaving the 1-24th Regiment in laager with all the
heavy baggage and supplies. Lord Chelmsford was
so pleased with Buller's magnificent reconnaissance,
that he determined to advance at once upon Ulundi,
giving every temptation to the Zulu army to attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
upon the plain which had been admirably surveyed
two days previously by Colonel Buller. Nothing
could have been better considered, nothing could
have been better planned, and nothing could have
been better worked out, than the details of this
splendid action. Every punctilio had been observed
by Lord Chelmsford as regards his answers and
promises to Cetywayo. The General had said he
would not cross the river, thereby placing himself
at some considerable disadvantage in a strategic
point, and yet up to noon of the 3rd instant no act
of submission was made. On the 4th, therefore, the
main body crossed after Wood's column, and knowing
that the Zulu army were somewhere between the
river and Ulundi, had good reason to hope that they
would show fight. Lord Chelmsford therefore advanced
boldly, and without any undue show of
caution, across the plain. They had nothing in the
shape of baggage with the exception of ammunition
and water-carts; but each man carried in his haversack
biscuit and preserved meat for four days.</p>

<p>The crossing of the river was made without any
opposition, although the movements of our troops
were carefully watched by a body of Zulus from a
neighbouring hillock on the left, and a more brilliant
and picturesque sight could not be imagined. The
banks of the river were covered with tamarinds and
acacia, growing right down to the water's edge;
while creeping plants, such as the convolvulus, the
jessamine, and the deadly nightshade, were festooned
from tree to tree. The wild guava, the pomegranate,
and many a sweetly-scented bush, pushed upward
their luxuriant undergrowth, and gave out faint
odours as they were crushed by the horses' hoofs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Bees were humming among the sweetly-scented
dholiocs, and the ripple of the stream as it rushed
and bubbled over the clear pebbles below made a
music that seemed out of place with thoughts of
bloodshed and strife. With Buller scouting far in
front, Wood's division led the van, Newdigate next,
and Drury-Lowe, with his gallant Lancers, brought
up the rear. The fortified camp on the right bank
of the Umvolosi had been left with a Gatling gun, 900
Europeans, and 250 natives, under Colonel Bellairs.
As soon as favourable ground had been reached,
Wood was signalled to halt and wait for the main
body; and the order was then given to form a large
hollow square, with the ammunition, two Gatlings,
and the entrenching tool-carts and bearers in the
centre. Inside this square were also two companies
of Engineers and some native Pioneers
attached, under Major Chard and Captain Ainsley,
together with the <i>impedimenta</i>, consisting of water-carts,
ambulance-waggons, and stretchers. The
square, although large, was not unwieldy, and the
steady marching of the men prevented the slightest
noise or confusion. The flying column under Wood
held the post of honour in the front half of the
square. Major Tucker, with the 80th Regiment,
and Major Owen and two Gatlings in the centre,
held the front face. On his right flank were two
7-pounders of Major Tremlett's battery, under
Lieutenant Davidson, with seven companies of the
13th Light Infantry, under Major England, supplemented
in continuation of the right face by two
more of Tremlett's guns, in charge of Captain Brown
and Lieutenant Slade; then came one 9-pounder of
Major Le Grice's battery, under Lieutenant Crookenden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
four fine companies of the 58th making up
the remainder of the right face. The rear face
was composed of one gun of Le Grice's battery, two
companies of the 21st Fusiliers, under Major Hazlerigg,
and three companies of the 94th, under Colonel
Malthus. On the left or west flank were the
remaining three companies of the 94th, two 7-pounders
of Major Harness's battery, under Lieutenant
Parsons; eight companies of the 90th, under
Major Rogers; and two guns of Major Le Grice's
battery, attached <i>pro tem.</i> to Major Harness, under
Lieutenant Elliott. Buller's Cavalry were away
scouring the front and flanks, while Colonel Drury-Lowe,
with two squadrons of the 17th Lancers,
and Captain Shepstone's Basutos, formed the rear
guard. The numbers of all ranks were as follows:&mdash;Flying
Column, 2192 Europeans and 573 natives;
Newdigate (2nd Division), 1870 Europeans and 530
natives; making a total of 5165 men.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford and his staff rode in the centre,
in rear of the front face. He, of course, assumed
the chief command; and his clear, sharp, soldierlike
voice rang out like a trumpet to the men: "The
square will wheel to the right." This order was
taken up by the division as quickly and calmly as
though by a brigade of Foot Guards at Aldershot
or the Curragh. After moving on for a few miles
they began to approach the smaller kraals; and
Buller, with his advanced and seemingly ubiquitous
riders, could be seen dashing here and there in every
direction to tempt the Zulu columns, which could
now be discerned along the horizon towards the left
front. At the extreme end of the plain the sun
glanced down upon a long line of white shields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
marching in a sort of double column, with skirmishers
thrown out in European fashion in front
and on the flanks. The square was now halted,
while the first kraal was fired. This, some of
Shepstone's Basutos said, was named Umlambo-Bogivimo,
and Buller's men having applied their flints
and steel to the task, the flames and smoke ascended
to the sky. Next they came to the great kraal of
King Panda, called Unodwengo; but although this
was at first fired, it was found the smoke acted as
such a screen to the Zulus that Lord Chelmsford
ordered its extinction. Strong columns could now
be seen moving out in quick though good order
from Ulundi, and as they seemed bearing down upon
the right front, the square took ground to the right
and was halted in a capital position, pointed out to
Lord Chelmsford by Buller. Our troops were now
assailed by a dropping but harmless fire from the
Ulundi column on the right front, and from a strong
Zulu force operating in some broken ground from
Unodwengo, now on the left. It was now half-past
eight, and by nine o'clock the Zulu attack was fully
developed. Buller's men then made a strong
demonstration on the left, driving the Zulus from
the hollow where they were sheltered, back to the
Unodwengo kraal. This movement was well supported
by Shepstone and his Basutos, who skirmished
splendidly on the left and rear face of the kraal.
While this, however, was going on, a Zulu on a
white horse was seen leading strong reinforcements
from his proper right to assist in the attack upon
the cavalry on the left. The scene was now most
exciting. Buller and his men fought in two ranks,
the first mounted and ready to dash at a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
upon any weak point in the enemy's line; the
second, dismounted, and making capital practice at
long ranges, with their saddles as a rest for the
rifle. As soon as the front rank became too hardly
pressed, they cantered to the rear, dismounted, and
relieved the second rank. This is the old Dutch mode
of fighting the Zulus, and it has rarely been found
unsuccessful. Colonel Lowe, at this juncture, asked
Lord Chelmsford's permission to send out a squadron
of his Lancers, or even a troop; but the general
wisely declined, as the ground was broken, and the
Zulu line too powerful to be charged. Nothing
could be finer than the way in which Buller and
Shepstone retired, bringing the Zulu columns and
their horns under the deadly hail of our Gatlings
and Martinis. Now, thought the Zulus, was the
time for their grand attack. Were not the mounted
men, under the terrible Buller, flying before the
fierce onslaught of the Zulu braves? Still the line
of white shields came roaring on, like the big white
billows that roll on to and break into foam upon the
South Afric shore. The ridges on the front and
left were now swarming with Zulus, fierce, stern,
and terrible, as with fiendish and maniacal shouts
they swept over the soft and springy veldt to be
shattered, bloody and broken in their pride, by the
leaden tempest that now whistled from all sides of
the square. "Steady, my lads; close up, fire low,
and not so fast!" cried Evelyn Wood, who had his
men under splendid control. "Are the mounted
men all in?" said Lord Chelmsford to General
Newdigate. "They are, my lord," replied Buller,
who was just lighting a cigarette. "Then give the
enemy a round or two of shrapnel," said the chief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Shells from the right and left were now poured in;
but still on came the line of white shields. File-firing
from the Martinis was poured in, but the Zulu
columns were deployed, and, regardless of the
<i>mitraille</i>, still came on in half-open order. But,
under cover of their strong lines of skirmishers, the
Zulu attack was now changed and further developed
on the rear face, where Malthus and Hazlerigg held
post. Hazlerigg, whose tall and stalwart form
was conspicuous above the files of his men, made
his front rank reserve its fire till the Zulus had
arrived within sixty yards, and then the word was
given to fire low and steady. The kraal of Unodwengo
was, it has been said, upon the left, and it
proved rather a thorn in the side. Behind the
rising ground from which the Basutos had been
driven now came a stream of thousands of Zulus
sweeping round the left flank from Ulundi. Their
wild yells and unearthly war-cries smote upon the
air, and were heard through the ping and rattle of
the rifle-fire. Under cover of the Unodwengo kraal,
and sweeping over the ground beyond, this strong
body, led by the chief on the white horse, formed a
hollow square, and after a few moments' pause to
collect themselves, dashed like a whirlwind upon the
right rear angle of the square. Now every one
knows that the angle of a square, like the salient
angle of a bastion, is its weakest point, and for a
moment it seemed a question whether the attack
would succeed. The angle was held by two of
Hazlerigg's companies, and although Le Grice's
solitary gun, admirably served, poured forth its
most deadly shells, and Hazlerigg kept his men
firing in the most steady manner, at one moment it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
seemed as though it would come to close quarters
fighting. But one terrific volley from the 21st, the
94th, the 58th, and Royal Engineers, shattered their
order, their square was broken, and after a moment's
pause they sought shelter from so terrific a fire.
Meanwhile the front attack had again developed,
and here the gallant 80th were placed at a certain
disadvantage. That awkward dip in their front
enabled the Zulus to make their formation for
attack out of sight and out of fire, so that Major
Tucker's men had to reserve their fire until the tops
of the enemies' heads were seen above the mound.
But the 80th behaved so coolly and so steadily that
the front attack at length slackened, and the Zulu
line wavered, and finally ceased to fire.</p>

<p>It was now a quarter to ten, and as signs of
wavering were remarked in every face of the attack,
Colonel Drury-Lowe at this juncture had been
allowed to file his men out from an opening in the
rear face, and was just forming them in squadrons,
when a spent ball knocked him off his charger. He
was stunned, however, only for a moment, and was
again in the saddle, smiling at his mishap. Now was
the moment for which the gallant Lancers had so
long waited. Now every man gripped his weapon
with stiffened sinews and determined heart. "Go at
them, colonel, but don't pursue too far!" shouted
Lord Chelmsford, as he raised his helmet to the men.
Moving first at a walk to steady his men, Lowe advanced
in column of troops from the right, and as
soon as the ground was favourable gave the words
in succession, "Trot!" "Form squadrons!" "Form
line!" "Gallop!" "Charge!" Away across the
broad grassy slopes, and greeted by a burst of cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
from the square, went the splendid blue-and-white
line, their pennons fluttering in the morning
air, and their bright and deadly steel-topped bamboo
lances in rest. On they went, driving the flying
Zulus headlong into a donga, where sweeping round
it the pursuing squadrons forced the enemy out into
the open to fly for safety towards the mountains
northward. But flanking the donga, and hidden by
the long grass, half of a Zulu regiment was posted
to cover the retreat, and as the squadrons of Drury-Lowe's
men came on a volley was poured in, which
emptied several saddles, and was fatal to poor young
Wyatt-Edgell, who was gallantly leading on his men.
His men, almost maddened as they saw him fall,
spurred more furiously on to take immediate and
bloody vengeance.</p>

<p>A moment more and the bristling line of steel
meets the black and shining wall of human flesh,
rent, pierced, and gashed by a weapon as death-dealing
and unsparing as their own assegai. Still,
though crushed and stabbed by the lances, and
though their firm array was scattered like sea-foam,
the Zulus fought on in stubborn knots, nor cried for
quarter, stabbing at the horses' bellies as they went
down, and trying to drag the men off their horses
in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>. The lance was now relegated in most
cases to its sling, and the heavy sabres of the troopers
became red with gore. Never was a cavalry attack
better timed or more effective, and never did that oft-abused
arm, the lance, better vindicate its reputation
as a weapon of pursuit. But now a troop of the
King's Dragoon Guards, under Captain Brewster,
and some irregular cavalry, are let loose from different
sides of the square, and, with Lord William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Beresford full six horse-lengths in advance, charge
full and fair upon the flying savages, who are cut
down in scores until they gain the crests of the hill;
but even there no safety or rest is found, for shrapnel,
fired with time-fuzes, scatters them like chaff in
the wind.</p>

<p>The attacking force consisted of twelve regiments,
and could not have been less than 23,000; 15,000
surrounding the British square, and 8000 in reserve.
Their loss has been estimated at 1500, but it should
probably be put down as double, for during the whole
of the action they could be seen carrying their dead
and wounded away. The total loss to our troops
was not heavy&mdash;some dozen killed and about eighty
wounded. Amongst those killed was one officer, of
whom might well be said, "We could have better
spared a better man." In the gallant white-and-blue
line of squadrons that swept like a torrent upon the
scared and flying Zulu hordes, there rode no braver,
no more knightly spirit than young, gallant Wyatt-Edgell.
The scion of a noble house, and a soldier
by hereditary tradition and birth, he had all the
accomplishments and chivalrous attributes of his
race. His loss was a great blow to all, and his
premature though glorious death cast a deep gloom
not only over his own regiment, but over the entire
camp in which he had spent so many cheerful days,
esteemed and loved by officers and men alike, from
highest to lowest.</p>

<p>After the battle of Ulundi and the destruction of
the king's five great kraals, Lord Chelmsford
marched his division back to Entonyani, where they
remained some days, having had a storm of rain and
thunder lasting thirty-six hours. As they had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
tents the first night, the state of affairs may more
easily be imagined than described. The rain came
down in perfect torrents, sweeping away the bivouac
fires and pouring through the camp like the overflow
of a mighty river. The men behaved admirably,
taking all the discomforts of their situation with the
good humour and jocularity of disciplined troops.
The horses naturally suffered most, although every
attempt was made to picket them in a sheltered spot.
On arriving at Entonyani they found tents waiting
for them, and were thus enabled to get dry and refit.
The nights were exceptionally cold and with heavy
dews, causing some little sickness amongst the men.</p>

<p>In fully estimating the importance of this battle,
we must not forget the surroundings, nor the associations
of the place. The valley of the Umvolosi is
essentially the heart of Zululand. It is the richest
and most fertile portion of the country, and as such
was chosen as the royal abode. The two branches
of the river, named after the district, converge
through it towards the main stream which flows on
to St. Lucia Bay. The one by which the king's
great kraal but lately stood passes through a comparatively
open country; and its waters, gleaming
clear in the sunlight, are called "White," just as the
waters of the other branch, which run through a
more bushy and broken district, are called "Black."
In the basin drained by this extensive water-system
the Zulu nation was originally cradled. Thither
Dingaan retired after he had slain his brother near
the Nonoti. There the brave and bustling Dutchman
Retief and his companions were treacherously
murdered in 1838; and there, again, Bongore, led into
a trap the unsuspecting Boers, who were again duped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
by his representations, they believing that the king
was alone at Mahlabatini. The valley where this last
battle was fought is with the Zulus a sacred and
historic spot. It is rife with what is most dear to
the Zulu pride&mdash;legends of bloody massacre, treacherous
surprise, and savage revenge. Dingaan fled
from thence; Panda died there; Cetywayo was first
recognized and crowned there. Could the tall and
wooded grey cliffs that looked down upon the combat
speak, they could tell, in a direful tale of tyrannous
cruelty and wrong, most of the annals of the Zulu
nation. Year by year they witnessed the periodical
gathering together of Cetywayo's legions, and watched
the steady outgrowth of the savage power whose
overthrow, by British troops and British discipline,
they beheld but a few months since. But signal and
satisfactory as this victory was, it could not be accepted
as final until Cetywayo had completely submitted,
though some of its effects were immediate
and important.</p>

<p>The day after the battle of Ulundi, and before the
victory was known to the troops of the 1st Division,
about 700 Zulus, with all their cattle, women, and
children, came into the camp at Richard's Cove, near
Port Durnford, to tender submission and to claim
protection. There is not the slightest doubt but
that they had heard of the battle, although there was
not a whisper of the engagement heard amongst
these people. General Crealock, to give importance
to the ceremony, ordered a general parade of the
division at midday, and it was impossible not to be
struck with the attenuated condition of his battalions,
although every available man was put on parade.
Both brigades made up rather a weak division. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
1st Brigade was made up of the Buffs, two companies
of the 88th, two companies of the "Shah's"
and "Active's" bluejackets, and one of the marine
artillery; while the 2nd Brigade was composed
of the Royal Artillery, 57th, 60th Rifles, and 91st&mdash;in
all twenty companies. At half past twelve the
General, surrounded by his staff, rode on to the
ground, and the division was wheeled into line.
Then a galloper was sent out to the Zulus who were
halted on the crest of the neighbouring hills, and
they were told to advance and lay down their arms.
Three hundred fine-looking fellows then advanced
in good order, and arriving at the prescribed distance,
made the customary obeisance while they
deposited assegais and guns, in number about
seventy, fire-arms mostly of the old pattern.</p>

<p>However, time proved that the results of Lord
Chelmsford's engagement and victory on the 4th
(July) were of far greater importance than had been
at first imagined. Chiefs and tribes came pouring
into the various camps, not by dozens or by scores,
but literally by hundreds, and the only two questions
they asked&mdash;and these kept invariably recurring&mdash;were
"Why was not the victory of Ulundi followed
up vigorously? and why was Cetywayo allowed to
escape?"</p>

<p>It was this great error of immediately retiring
from Ulundi which made us again ridiculous, not
only in the eyes of Zululand, but also in those of
military Europe. It was due, not to Lord Chelmsford,
nor those under his command, but to extraneous
influences beyond his control; and public
opinion never arrived at a more true or just conclusion
than in saying that the arrival of Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Chelmsford's successor, no matter how valuable or
how necessary it might have been, came at a most
inopportune time, for it was well known that Lord
Chelmsford's plans were so perfectly matured, that
had he been left free to carry out his own designs,
instead of being hampered and constrained by the
orders of the new Commander-in-chief, he would
have followed up Ulundi with the utmost possible
activity, and would in all probability have secured
the person of the king. Terms for the final pacification
of the whole of Zululand could then have
been dictated on the spot, and there would have
been an end to the entire business.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances therefore Lord Chelmsford
determined to resign all command; and within
three days of the brilliant victory of Ulundi it was
known to the soldiers throughout the camp that
their General was about to leave them, and that
with him were going Sir Evelyn Wood, General
Crealock, and Colonel Redvers Buller. Accordingly
a grand parade of all arms was ordered on the
morning of the 8th (July), that the General might
take a formal leave of his men. At nine a.m. the
bugle-call for coverers was sounded, the staff
officers marked the alignment, and the various
corps moved like clockwork upon their respective
pivots. The division was then wheeled into line by
General Newdigate, and the flanks, bringing forward
their right and left shoulders, three sides of a large
hollow square was formed, with the front ranks
facing inwards. Lord Chelmsford, his staff, and
three brigadiers formed the fourth side of the square,
and in a few warm-hearted, well chosen, and soldierlike
sentences the Commander-in-chief, under whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the troops had seen so much good hard work,
honest service, and from whom all ranks had
received at various times some recognition of their
conduct in camp and on the field of battle, bade
them farewell, and thanked them for the manner in
which their duty to their Queen and country had
been performed. "For the courage, the coolness,
and the devotion you have all displayed wherever I
have been with you, I give you my best and my
warmest thanks. For the unselfish devotion and
untiring energy and good-humour with which you
have encountered hardship, fatigue, and privation I
find it hard to sufficiently express my gratitude.
In all senses you have done your duty as English
soldiers." Such were the concluding words of a
leader whom all loved, respected, and all regretted.</p>

<p>On the following day the camp bivouac was
broken up, and the cavalry, the 2nd Division, and
the flying column, marched <i>en route</i> to Intanjaneni
and Kwamagwasa, thus beyond doubt leading
Cetywayo and his indunas to suppose that their
losses at Ulundi and want of military skill caused
them to forego the advantages they had won.</p>

<p>Despatches from General Crealock fully demonstrate
that his inability to effect a junction with the
2nd Division before the action at Ulundi was due to
no want of energy or organization on his part, but
solely to those causes which will impede the movements
of all bodies of civilized troops in uncivilized
lands. But although sickness amongst the oxen
and other impediments to transport caused General
Crealock to lose his share of the victory gained, his
time had not been wasted, for much valuable work
was done in the nature of road-making and raiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
over the enemy's country, thus affording a diversion
which considerably weakened Cetywayo's chances
of inflicting a defeat upon the other column. The
task of establishing the new base of supply at Port
Durnford and the building of Fort Napoleon was
thrown entirely upon the 1st Division, and naturally
interfered with its rapid advance. The work, however,
that fell to the coast column was fully and
admirably carried out, and a pontoon and a trestle-bridge
were built over the Tugela, without which
no important advance could have been made along
the coast. The ford over the Inyoni was rendered
permanently practicable, and can, now that the
descent is made easy for waggons, be passed at all
seasons. The same work was effected at the Umsundusi
and Amatikula rivers, whose approaches
were made safe for wheels. The Umkusi and
Inyezani hills and drifts were also made passable
by improvement in the roads. Along the Umlatoosi
valley numerous small but difficult streams
had drifts made over them. From the Umlatoosi
to St. Paul's Mission Station used to be a bad
and most difficult road, but all the dangerous
places were now levelled, and a strong and defensible
position was given. Fords were secured across the
Uvulu, the Entonjaneni, the Umvolosi, and the
Umlalasi, and there no physical obstacle was allowed
to remain to delay the march of a European column
with its baggage in any part of the coast and the
south of Zululand, while forts had been completed
or erected at Tenedos, Pearson, Crealock, Chelmsford,
Napoleon, and Durnford.</p>

<p>The result of this was that Sir Garnet Wolseley,
in taking over Lord Chelmsford's command, found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
a complete chain of military posts, the like of which
was never before seen in South Africa, extending
along the Zulu frontier from the Blood and Buffalo
rivers to the Umvolosi mouth and Port Durnford,
and, in fact, encompassing three out of four sides of
Cetywayo's kingdom.</p>

<p>In addition to the formation of the new base and
the seaward communications the later operations of
Barrow's cavalry fully vindicated the reputation
they had obtained for activity. Barrow's Irregular
Mounted Corps, although not so numerous as those
of Buller, were equally worthy of praise, alike for
their admirable discipline, courage in action, and
skill in patrolling. They consisted of about fifty
enrolled volunteers under Captain Addison, forming
a body called the "Natal Guides," three troops of
Lonsdale's Mounted Rifles, three of the Mounted
Infantry, the Natal Horse, and a very useful contingent
of mounted natives. These, under such
leaders as Colonel Barrow, Major Lord Gifford,
Captains Barton and Nettleton, were at once the
eyes and ears of the column. On July 6th Barrow's
men made a forced march, during which they were
thirty hours in the saddle, and, reaching Ondini,
the king's old kraal, burnt it to the ground. The
patrol paraded overnight, and started some two
hours before daylight, making its way through a
valley district over fifteen miles in length by three
or four in breadth, though here and there narrowing
in parts to only one mile, over lofty spurs and
ridges running into it, forming a series of densely-wooded
and impracticable ravines. The weather
was intensely hot, and although the men and
horses were both distressed at times, the troops did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
their work in a manner which reflected great credit
upon all present. From this valley the road or trek
ran for ten or twelve miles through an open but
rather broken country, the hills in the distance
being covered with dense bush. The patrol then
turned eastwards over a table-land which stretched
away for about twenty miles, till the edge of the
plateau is reached, and the path descends abruptly
into the great thorn valley to the west of the White
Umvolosi; at the edge of this plateau the coast road
joins. From this point the patrol marched a few
miles, and halted for off-saddle and breakfast on the
right bank of the river. The road is fairly good,
but passes through thick thorn-bush, and the country
is very broken and contains a number of small
streamlets tributary to the Umvolosi. The drift
here is good, and is commanded by a high stony
hill to the north and upon the right of the road,
and within rifle range of one of the smaller royal
kraals. The Ondini kraal was reached about noon.
It was occupied by some Zulus, who made away as
the troops advanced at a canter; the place was fired,
and in half an hour was utterly destroyed. The
return to camp was made by another road, which
was long and tedious; several of the horses were
completely knocked up, one dying from exhaustion
and several having to be abandoned on the road.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> is now time to turn attention to the movements
of the new Commander-in-chief and Governor. On
the 28th of June his Excellency Sir Garnet Wolseley
and his staff landed at Durban from the C.R.M.S.
"Dunkeld." The whole town was that day <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>,
as the Durbanites like a sensation, no matter of
what nature. At daylight the whole of the military
and naval authorities were astir, and various
coloured bunting began to appear all over the town.
Crowds of well-to-do shopkeepers and farmers went
down to the point on horseback, while hundreds
went by the train. All the ships in the harbour
and the bluff were gaily decorated, and the men-of-war,
transports, and merchant-vessels were gallantly
dressed in bunting from stem to stern. Sir Garnet
brought with him many of his old staff, and others
joined later on. Colonel Pomeroy Colley arrived by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the next Zanzibar steamer, and took up the duties
of chief of the staff, and Captain Lord Gifford
joined from his regiment, the 57th. Sir Garnet
Wolseley was not only to be Governor, Commander-in-chief,
and High Commissioner in Natal and the
Transvaal, but also to exercise the functions of the
latter office in the countries to the north and to the
east.</p>

<p>The changes ordered by the new Commander-in-chief
were numerous and important. In the first
place all military operations against Secocoeni were
to be discontinued. This order gave great dissatisfaction,
as several highly successful patrols had
already been made against this chieftain; and Colonel
Lanyon, after great delay and difficulty having completed
his arrangements for the attack, was actually
on his way to the front, when instructions reached
him to stop and send his men to Derby, to protect
that part of the border from Zulu raids.</p>

<p>The troops were to be immediately consolidated
and reduced, and with them the expenses of the
war.</p>

<p>The landing of the Marines was countermanded,
and they were to be sent back with all possible
speed to Simon's Bay; the Natal Carabineers, the
Durban Mounted Rifles, Bettington's Horse, and
the Frontier Light Horse were to be forthwith disbanded:
the 1st Division and the Cavalry brigade
were to be broken up; while the forts along the
coast were to be abandoned. The following troops
were also named for immediate embarkation:&mdash;1-24th,
the 3rd (Buffs), the 99th, the 88th, the 1st
battalion 13th, and two batteries of artillery, to
proceed to England; the 17th Lancers to go on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
India; Ellaby's and Tremlett's batteries to proceed
to St. Helena. Lord Chelmsford, Generals Marshall,
Wood, and Crealock, Colonels Crealock, Downe,
Dawney, and Buller, Captains Buller, Molyneux,
Frere, Milne, Grenfell, Beresford, and Reilly were
going home, either by order or at their own request.
Indeed almost the only officer of high position who
elected, or was selected, to remain was General
Clifford, who still retained his post of Inspector-General
of the lines of communication.</p>

<p>Sir Garnet's plan of operations for the future was
as follows: a military post at Durnford with 400
men; another at St. Paul's, with a brigade; and a
third at Intanjaneni with 400 men; a regiment to
remain on the Umlatoosi, and a battalion of the
Native Contingent to guard the line of the Tugela.
Colonel Baker Russell was to start at once with a
flying column from St. Paul's and co-operate with
Oham in the west. Colonel George Villiers was to
proceed to join Oham and organize various bodies
of burghers, Natal natives, and Zulus, to hem in
Cetywayo in that direction, whilst McLeod (late
74th Regiment) was to raise, equip, and command
5000 warriors of the Amaswazis, and, if necessary,
lead them right into Zululand. Colonel Clarke
(57th) meanwhile was to march straight on Ulundi,
there to await Sir Garnet's arrival, with a force
consisting of the 57th, 60th, five companies of the
80th, two troops of Lonsdale's Horse, one battalion
of the Natal Native Contingent, and some mounted
natives under the chiefs Jemptse and Mafionge,
together with a battery of Gatlings and the Natal
Pioneers. Meanwhile Sir Garnet had convened a
great council of Zulu chieftains to be held at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Paul's, July 19th, to arrive if possible at some
definite arrangement for the temporary government
of the country. Such were the main features of the
new commander's programme, and though severe
strictures were at first passed thereupon by the
majority of the colonists and old soldiers experienced
in Kaffir warfare, time proved that his calculations
were just and well-founded.</p>

<p>Leaving Durban on the 2nd of July, Sir Garnet
and staff embarked on board her Majesty's ship
"Shah," and proceeded to Durnford, where several
attempts to land were made, but without success.
On the morning of the 3rd, the steam-tug "Koodoo"
came alongside, and Sir Garnet and his staff,
including the two Colonels Russell, Captains Buchanan,
Maurice, Braithwaite, and Baynes, Dr. Russell,
and Mr. Herbert (private secretary), were with
great difficulty and no little risk embarked on her
and subsequently transferred to a surf-boat or lighter.
While towing the lighter towards the shore the hawser
broke, but most fortunately a sail was hoisted at
once, and the boat, getting clear of the breakers,
was again taken in tow by the "Koodoo." After
several ineffectual attempts to get the lighter made
fast to the warp, the recall was fired from the
"Shah," and Sir Garnet returned to the man-of-war.
As the day wore on the surf became worse,
and towards evening Captain Bradshaw, commanding
the "Shah," deemed it no longer safe to remain
at anchor off the bar. Sir Garnet therefore returned
to Durban, and hastening on overland <i>vi&acirc;</i> Forts
Chelmsford, Pearson, and Crealock, reached the
camp of the 1st Division at Richard's Cove, Port
Durnford, on July 6th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th an advance column, consisting of
Buller's Light Horse about 100, two guns, the 57th
Regiment, the whole under Colonel B. Russell, C.B.,
left camp and marched in the direction of St. Paul's,
as far as the Umlatoosi, where they entrenched themselves
on the right bank, the cavalry and Dunn's scouts
forming an advanced guard on the left. This position
commands a path about ten miles from the mouth
of the river, and the site is very picturesque, overlooking
the valley to the north-west. His Excellency
and headquarter staff accompanied the column, and
the next morning pushed on to St. Paul's with an
escort of cavalry, where were the headquarters of
the 2nd Division. A parade of the troops, including
the 17th Lancers and some 500 irregular cavalry&mdash;the
celebrated Buller's Horse&mdash;was held, and the
General, after taking leave of Lord Chelmsford,
Brigadier General Wood, Colonel Buller, who with
their staffs were leaving for England, returned to
the camp on the Umlatoosi. It has been already
said that the 19th was fixed by Sir Garnet Wolseley
for the meeting or durbar of the principal chiefs, all
of whom were expected to attend. By noon on that
day the camp presented a curious sight. Outside
the General's tent a guard of honour, with the
Queen's colours, was drawn up, while a large space
was railed off for the reception of Zulu visitors,
who came winding in bands over the slopes of the
neighbouring hills from an early hour in the morning.
As each deputation from its respective tribe came
into camp, preceded by its principal rulers, it was
formed up in a sort of column, sixteen or eighteen
feet deep, in the space set apart for the visitors.
The gathering was a numerous one, upwards of 250<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
chiefs and their followers having attended, and
evidently considering the occasion as one of great
importance, as each man was attired in his most
gorgeous manner. The enclosure was at the same
time council-chamber and reception-hall, and although
no seats were required, skins, mats, and
canvas were put down for the principal chiefs to sit
upon. Some of the chiefs had a covering of cow's
tails and other skins round the waist, while broad
rings of copper were worn round the arms and
ankles of others. Plumes of feathers adorned the
heads of the principal men, and hanging behind,
somewhat after the fashion of a Hungarian pelisse,
each warrior wore a panther or other similar skin.
The array of dusky savages looked fairly imposing,
although none of them were armed save with the
knobkerrie of place, which as they squatted was
laid methodically in front of each man. Upon the
hills in the distance were a number of boys and
women who had accompanied the chiefs, but who
preferred to remain outside spectators of the conference.
The enclosure was marked out by branches
of the mimosa, cut in convenient lengths, and forming
a sort of palisade, which kept the crowd from
intruding. When all were reported present, Sir
Garnet and his staff, accompanied by Mr. Fynny,
border agent, came out of his tent, and the guard
having presented arms, the proceedings commenced.
The two principal chiefs were the king's brothers,
Dabulamanzi and Magwendi, who both replied to
Sir Garnet's speech. Dabulamanzi was a fine-looking
man of large size, apparently in the full
vigour of his age, and of great muscular development,
presenting in this regard a striking contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
to his brother Oham, who was simply a large fat
man. There was an air of considerable thought and
command in his face, and, unlike the other chiefs,
who wore their hair closely cropped, except with a
black band round the temples, his hair was thrown
back and his broad forehead was encircled with a
fillet of ostrich feathers terminating with a single
plume behind. Heavy rings of highly polished
copper spanned the thick part of the arms of Magwendi,
a much shorter and more common-looking
man, and whose neck was adorned with a necklace
formed of monkey's teeth and small shells. Both
these chiefs held in their right hands the same kind
of short stick carried by their warriors, while their
left hands rested on their naked knees. Mr. Fynny,
the well-known border agent, who was considered to
know almost as much about Zululand and the Zulus
as Mr. John Dunn, and that is saying much, performed
the duties of interpreter with remarkable
skill and fluency, translating Sir Garnet's speech,
sentence by sentence, as it was uttered, with due
emphasis and point. Sir Garnet Wolseley spoke as
nearly as possible to the following effect: "I am
very pleased to welcome you to my camp, because
your coming in answer to my invitation shows you
are as anxious for peace as I am myself, and as is
the great Queen in whose name I now speak. We
came to make war with Cetywayo, not with the
Zulu people, and to put an end to his cruelties and
his military system, which with his marriage laws
made life and property unsafe in your land. We
want peace with the Zulus, and that they shall be
at peace with our people in Natal. We have beaten
the king in open fight and burnt his kraal, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
he is now a fugitive and shall never more reign in
Zululand. We might now take all Zululand, but
we do not want any of it, and we wish that all of
you should have your property and land. I rode
to St. Paul's the other day, and found all the people
on the way living quietly in their own kraals, and
with their cattle in them. All may do the same,
but all must first give up their arms and the king's
cattle in token of their submission. The old laws
of Zululand shall be restored, and you shall be ruled
by your own chiefs, whom you all know. I shall
divide the kingdom into four or five districts, and
all men shall be free to come and go, to work, to
marry, and to become rich. The great Queen, who
sends me, wishes the Zulus should be happy, but
those who continue to bear arms, and will not
submit, must be given up. On the north the
Swazis and the Amatongas are only kept by my
orders from invading Zululand, while Oham and his
soldiers are moving upon the west. I am going
myself to Ulundi on the 10th, where I shall tell
the Zulu people my arrangements for the future
government of the country." This address was
listened to with great attention, and with the most
respectful silence, and several of the chiefs replied,
one in particular making the naive and rather sarcastic
remark that he and his friends could not see
what fault Cetywayo had committed, but as the
English chiefs had seen it they were satisfied.
Dabulamanzi did not speak, except to Magwendi,
who rose and complained that his cattle had been
taken from him, and that some of them had been
sent in as belonging to the king. Redress was at
once promised by Sir Garnet. The meeting then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
broke up, the chieftains undertaking to meet Sir
Garnet again at Ulundi on August 10th, to arrive at
a final settlement of affairs.</p>

<p>It has been before mentioned that General Crealock
had determined to resign his command of the
1st Division; it was in pursuance of this resolution
that he ordered a general parade on July 21st, on
which occasion he made a short but appropriate
speech to his men.</p>

<p>There were on parade the Buffs, 60th Rifles, 91st,
the naval brigade of the "Boadicea," one company
of Marines, two troops of Lonsdale's Horse, one
troop of Natal Horse, and a battery of 7-pounders.
This little army was drawn up on the usual parade-ground,
not far from the river, and in the midst of a
scene of the greatest natural beauty. The banks of
the stream are thickly wooded, and the valley is the
resort of large species of game. Crocodiles frequent
the river, and make it dangerous to bathe. Thick,
thorny underwood, mingled with tall reeds and date-palms,
grow close down to the waters, which reflect
the tall green trees that overarch above. Trees,
with branches bearing bright green leaves and yellow
fragile flowers, drooped nearly to the ground around
the plain. Pre-eminent in splendour shone out the
brilliant <i>combretta</i>, whose masses of bloom gleamed
like torches amidst the dark green of the thickets,
whilst the golden sheen of the fruit intensified the
marked contrast of the tints. At the drinking-place
used for the horses the water flowed in streamlets
over the rocks and along a long red sandbank. A
ledge of granite forms a rugged barrier eight or ten
feet high across the river, and down the hollows of
this the clear waters rush and ripple in rills, cascades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
and rapids, bubbling and eddying among the
great masses of rock below, in many of which, like
those of the Zambesi, great holes are worn by stones
which during the flood perhaps had settled in small
hollows. Dark lines of trees border the river on the
right, and on the left there is a fine grove of baobabs
with large dark green leaves and wide-spreading
branches. Crossing a sandstone hill with a spur
stretching away to the eastward, and adorned with
some splendid specimens of the encephalartos, or
Kaffir bread, and then descending into the valley of
the Umlalasi, one comes to sandstone and gneiss,
rising in cliffs of 600 feet on the south of the river,
but sloping away gradually on the north. The
banks are covered with verdant and golden-blossomed
acacias, some of them with yellow bark and the
sweet gum, which is said to indicate the presence of
the tsetse fly. Away to the north are to be seen
groves of palm and mimosas, with stems forty feet
to the lower branches. Far away beyond the plain
can be seen the purple outlines of the great Lebombo
range of mountains. These are to the east of the
Drakenberg, and intervene between it and the sea.
Stretching northward from the Pongolo river, this
range crosses the Oliphant and touches the Limpopo.
Its highest elevation is about 2150 feet high, and at
the point at which the Umvolosi passes through the
range to Delagoa Bay there is a lofty peak which
reaches to 1900 feet, the river bed being there only
300 feet above sea level. Further north the range
declines, and is cut through by the Pongolo and the
Usuta, tributaries of the Maputa; also by the Umvolosi,
the Umcomazi, the Sabia, and the Oliphant,
all of which run into the Indian Ocean. Such were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the features of the landscape, and such was the
background to this farewell parade.</p>

<p>After the division had wheeled into line a very
creditable march past was performed, and the troops
then wheeled into a square, and were addressed by
General Crealock, who told them that, in obedience
to orders received from Sir Garnet Wolseley, the
column was to be broken up and dispersed. The
General said that he took this opportunity, before
separating, to thank all hands for their good conduct
and constant hard work, carried on without a
murmur and in the midst of many difficulties. The
task allotted to the 1st Division was to establish a
series of posts along the coast of Zululand with an
advanced dep&ocirc;t of supplies, to open a base of supplies
at Port Durnford, from which to feed a force
operating against Ulundi, and finally to destroy the
military kraals and clear the district of Zulus. All
these instructions were fully carried out by the 1st
Division by the 5th of July; and the General, in
wishing them a hearty good-bye and success and
prosperity, thanked all for the good conduct and
zeal which enabled him to do so much.</p>

<p>Lord Chelmsford, who was now on his way home
to England, received most enthusiastic receptions at
Maritzburg, Durban, and Capetown. The banquet
given in his honour at Pietermaritzburg was, perhaps,
the most brilliant affair of the kind ever
achieved in the colony, but there were those who
considered the ball in Durban as a still greater, for
there were more ladies and officers present who had
come long distances to assist at the festivity. Sir
Garnet Wolseley and the Lieutenant Governor, Sir
Evelyn Wood, and his <i>Fidus Achates</i>, Colonel Buller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Major-General Clifford, and all the fighting and
dancing men within a hundred miles of the place
responded to the call. Durban never before saw
such a display of "rank, beauty, and fashion."
All the belles of Natal were there to welcome the
winner of Ulundi, and to sympathize with him in
his efforts, under adverse criticisms and untoward
fortune, to do his duty as a soldier of our Queen.
The general feeling of the colony may be gathered
from the mayor's speech, who, in proposing his
lordship's health, said that he felt doubly proud on
the occasion, as he did not speak alone for himself,
but in the name and with the voice of all Natal.
Against difficulties which only colonial experience
could realize, and against bitter and most vituperative
criticism, Lord Chelmsford had worked steadily
and patiently until he accomplished the object he
was sent to perform. The General, in reply, expressed
in a soldierlike and impressive manner his
deep sense of the kind feelings expressed by the
mayor, and acknowledged that the reception accorded
to him had quite overwhelmed him. But in giving
his acknowledgments and thanks, his lordship made
a happy allusion to the devotion and zeal of those
who commanded and fought under him; and when
he came to the mention of Evelyn Wood and Redvers
Buller&mdash;two names which, he said, represented all
that a soldier could show in loyalty and efficiency&mdash;his
modest eulogium upon these, "his right hand
and left hand supports during the war," was perhaps
the most well received and telling point of his
address. That Wood's services were appreciated
by the colonists may be gathered from the fact that
he was most warmly solicited by Mr. Gordon Sprigg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the Premier, to accept the appointment of Commandant-General
of the Colonial Forces; and this
request was made by the almost unanimous wish of
the whole ministry. Sir Evelyn, however, did not
feel at liberty to accept till he had consulted with
the authorities at home.</p>

<p>On August 5th, Lord Chelmsford, Sir Evelyn
Wood, Colonel Crealock, Colonel Buller, Major
Grenfell, Captain Molyneux, and Captain Buller,
embarked on board the Union steamship "German,"
and sailed for England, where they arrived safely
and were received with the honours they had so
worthily deserved.</p>

<p>After the meeting of chiefs on the 19th, at the
camp on the Umlatoosi, Sir Garnet Wolseley returned
to Pietermaritzburg. Here he was engaged in
arranging matters of detail until July 29th. Disturbances
in Pondoland and the Transvaal also now
claimed his attention. In the former the Pondos
had attacked the Xesibes, a tribe in alliance with
England and under British protection. Hither
Lieutenant-Colonel Bayley, with a detachment of
Cape Mounted Rifles, was despatched from Butterworth,
and soon succeeded in putting an end to this
trouble. In the Transvaal the Boers were agitating
for a repeal of the union, and threatening to assert
their independence by force of arms. To render
matters secure in this quarter Sir Garnet sent the
headquarters of the King's Dragoon Guards, under
Colonel Alexander, to Pretoria. On the 30th the
Commander and his staff moved to Greytown and
thence on, with a small escort, to the temporary
camp at Umsingu. Travelling herefrom with all
speed he reached Rorke's Drift early the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
morning (August 3rd). Despatches were waiting
here for the Commander-in-chief, and determined
the next week's movements. Cetywayo was still
reported in a kraal in the Ngome, while letters were
at hand from Villiers giving anything but a flattering
account of his friend Oham and his promised
Burgher and native levies. M'Leod also wrote to
point out the difficulties under which he was labouring
with his Swazis, and asking for some European
troops to be sent to him to keep them under control.
Villiers was concentrating his heterogeneous
gathering of levies at Luneberg, and hoped to be
ready on or by the 6th; while M'Leod suggested
that he should merely guard the frontier to prevent
Cetywayo's escape, and not tempt his savages with
the sight of their enemy's kraals or cattle; for to
allow them to cross the border would be, he wrote,
risking murder, rapine, and all sorts of atrocities,
which, if once begun, it would be impossible to
stop.</p>

<p>So little is generally known of the Swazis, that a
short description of their persons and habits may
here be acceptable. What are usually called Swazis
are, in reality, somewhat a mongrel race, being a
cross between the Zulu and the old race of Swaziland.
The Swazis living along the borders of the
Wakkerstroom, until late owed allegiance to Cetywayo,
and some of them indeed had fought for him,
notably Manyoyaba, a chief paramount in the
Abakalusian district. But quarrels arose between
the two races and they became most bitter foes;
indeed once the Swazis were near extermination at
the hands of the Zulus.</p>

<p>The whole tribe possess characteristically broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
heads with thick hair, which would be as frizzly as
that of a negro were it not carefully dressed in the
Zulu fashion with plaster of grease and red clay.
Their eyes, almond-shaped and somewhat sloping,
are shaded with thick, sharply-defined brows, and
are of remarkable size and fulness. The wide space
between them testifies to the unusual width of the
skull, and contributes a mingled expression of animal
ferocity, warlike resolution, and, strange to say,
ingenuous candour. A flat, square nose, a mouth of
about the same width as the nose, with very thick
lips; a round chin, and full, plump cheeks complete
the countenance which may be described as circular
in its general contour. The bodies of the Swazis
are generally inclined, like those of the Zulus, to
be fat, but they are seldom wanting in muscular
strength. They are fairly well proportioned, but the
upper part of the figure is somewhat long in proportion
to the legs, and this peculiarity gives a strange
character to their movements, although it does not
seem any bar to their agility in their war-dances.
Nothing can be more simple than the ordinary headgear
of the women. It would, however, be a matter
of some difficulty to find any kind of plait, tuft, or
topknot, which has not been used by the Swazi
men. The hair is usually parted right down the
middle; towards the forehead it branches off so as to
leave a kind of triangle, and from the fork which is
thus formed, a tuft is raised and carried back to be
fastened behind. On either side of this tuft the hair
is arranged in rolls, like the ridges and crevices of a
melon, while over the temples separate rolls are
gathered up into knots, from which hang more tufts,
twisted like a cord, that fall in bunches round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
neck, three or four of the largest tresses being
allowed to go free over the breast and shoulders.
A favourite decoration is formed with the teeth of a
dog strung together under the hair and hanging
along the forehead like a fringe. Another ornament
not at all uncommon is worn by some, and this is
ivory cut in imitation of lions' teeth, and arranged
in radial fashion round the breast, the effect of the
white substance in contrast with the dark skin being
very striking. The weapons of the Swazis are
much the same as those of the Zulus, but they have
more variety in shape and quality of the assegai.
The shields are smaller, and usually woven of stout
reeds and then covered with undressed hide. They
use also a heavy kind of lance which is adapted to
the chase of large game.</p>

<p>A favourite amusement is a kind of war-dance, in
which a warrior describes a conflict in which he was
once engaged. Thus a chief may be often seen with
his assegais in one hand, his woven shield and knobkerrie
in the other, with his knife in his girdle, and
his limbs encircled by a skin, to which are attached
the tails of the wild cat and other animals. Adorned
on his breast and on his forehead by strings of teeth,
the trophies of war or of the chase, his large keen
eyes gleaming from beneath his heavy brow, his
white and pointed teeth shining from between his
parted lips, he alternately advances and retires before
an imaginary foe, with a wild yet dramatic grace,
which adds life and reality to the tale he is telling.
In describing these people, it is hard to determine
how far they should be deemed a race of hunters or
of agriculturists, the two occupations being apparently
equally distributed between the sexes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
men most assiduously devote themselves to their
hunting, and leave the care of the cattle and the
culture of the soil to be carried on exclusively by the
women. Now and then, indeed, the men bring home
fruits, tubers, and funguses from their excursions
in the forests, but practically they do nothing for
their families beyond providing them with game.
The agriculture of Swaziland, like that of Zululand
involves but a small amount of labour. The area of
the arable land is certainly limited, but the exuberant
productiveness of the soil, scarcely to be surpassed
in any part of the world, makes the cultivation
of the country supremely easy, and provides the
people with all they want. The entire land is,
besides, pre-eminently rich in spontaneous products,
animal and vegetable alike, and these conduce to a
direct maintenance in comparative ease of human
life. Manioc, sweet potatoes, yams, are cultivated
with little trouble, and all yield good crops. Plantains
are rarely seen. Although the Swazis have a
few carefully prepared dishes, of which they partake
on high feasts and festivals, in a general way they
exhibit as little nicety or choice in their diet as the
Amaxosas or the Zulus. They have one dish, however,
on which they pride themselves, and this most
palatable mess is composed of the pulp of fresh
maize, ground or pounded while the grain is soft and
milky, cleansed from the bran, and prepared carefully,
so that it is not burnt to the bottom of the pot.
The mode of preparation is ingenious. A little
water having been put over the fire, until it is just
beginning to boil, the raw meal, which has previously
been rolled into small lumps, is very gently shaken
in, and, having been allowed to simmer for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the whole is finally stirred up together. The acme,
however, of all earthly enjoyments to these people
would seem to be meat. "Meat!" is a watchword
that one hears in all their campaigns, and beyond all
doubt the alacrity with which these people responded
to M'Leod's appeal was caused by the anticipations
of devouring Cetywayo's cattle. Amongst their
other accomplishments may be mentioned the art
they possess of making from malted eleusine a very
palatable species of beer. This drink, which by the
Swazis is prepared from the eleusine, is really capable,
from the skill with which it is manipulated, of
laying a very fair claim to be known as beer. It is
quite bright, of a reddish pale brown colour, and is
regularly brewed from the malted grain, without the
addition of any extraneous ingredient. It has,
moreover, a pleasant bitter flavour derived from the
dark husks, which, if they were mixed in their natural
condition with the dough, would impart a twang
that would be exceedingly unpalatable. How large
is the proportion of beer consumed by the Swazis
may be estimated by simply observing the ordinary
manner in which they store their corn. As a rule
there are three granaries allotted to each dwelling,
of which two are made to suffice for the supply
which is to contribute the meal necessary for the
household, and the other is entirely devoted to the
grain that has been malted.</p>

<p>On August 4th Sir Garnet Wolseley left Rorke's
Drift, and, after inspecting the several posts <i>en route</i>,
reached Intanjaneni on the evening of the 6th.
Intanjaneni is admirably situated for a central
rendezvous as well as a dep&ocirc;t of supplies. It is on
the left bank of the Umlatoosi, or Slater's River, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
stream which is constantly confounded by careless
geographers with the Umlalazi, which is ten miles
further to the south-west. Hither General Clarke
and his column had preceded him; messengers also
had already come in from Umnyama, Cetywayo's
prime minister, from Tyengwayo, who was second in
command at Isandhlwana, and likewise from the
headmen Usukame and Umkilebani; all these men
said they would come in if their lives were spared
and their property not confiscated. Many other
chiefs were also in correspondence and treaty with
the General, and all had promised to come to Ulundi
on the 10th August.</p>

<p>On the 7th August messengers came from another
chief of importance, by name Mbelebele, whose
kraal was situated on the eastern bank of the Black
Umvolosi, about twenty miles N.N.E. of the old
kraal at Ondini. A party was sent, in accordance
with his request, to meet him halfway between his
kraal and Fort Victoria, the new post near Ulundi.
The interview, which took place at the foot of the
mountain range of the Lebombo, was short and
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mbelebele brought with him over 200 guns. He
also brought information that Mangondo, another
chief whose dwelling is near the Inkankla, would
surrender if assured of safety against the vengeance
of the king. Mbelebele seems to have been a man
much trusted by the other chiefs, as he had been in
correspondence with the younger brother of Cetywayo,
Tyami, Usmwelu, Usiteon, and with Sekatewayo,
a northern chief, who all manifested a wish to
come in and surrender their arms, cattle, and ammunition,
provided life and safety were assured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
The chief, in speaking of the king, although somewhat
reticent on some points, was certainly not so
on others, and stoutly maintained that Cetywayo
had doubled upon his pursuers, and so far from
being, as was thought, on his way westward to
Secocoeni, was in all likelihoods heading back towards
a kraal beyond the Lebombo range, called
Mussipulo. This information, of course, was at once
sent to Lord Gifford and to Colonel Baker Russell.</p>

<p>Sir Garnet Wolseley's next move was on to Fort
Victoria, Ulundi, where he arrived on August 9th.
On the following day he received information which
eventually led to the capture of Cetywayo; but of
this we shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> the meshes of the net spread for King
Cetywayo's capture were being more and more
closely woven. Colonel Villiers, who it has been
before mentioned had been sent to Oham's district,
having got together a force of 65 Europeans and
3050 natives in a fair state of organization, had
by August 13th advanced as far as the Assegai
river, so as to form a junction with M'Leod and
his 5000 Swazis, at that time on the banks of the
Pongolo, and thus complete the chain round that
side of the Zulu country.</p>

<p>Lord Gifford, with a number of Jantjis, was following
up the king, whilst 200 of the 57th were also
in pursuit, carefully patrolling the hills that lay
beyond Amansekranze, ably seconded by 500 of
Barton's natives. The Intanjaneni district, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Middle Drift to Victoria and St. Paul's, was laid
down with a line of piquets, whose orders were to
keep strict watch by night and day. The escape of
the Zulu monarch therefore appeared an impossibility.
The Jantjis just spoken of merit a few
words of description, not only on account of the
good services they rendered, but also because in
some points they differ vastly from other South
African tribes. The men of this race are fine, active,
and well made, standing not unusually six feet
in height. Their clothing consists simply of a
blanket, worn in peace time in the manner of a
Roman toga, but on the war-path invariably discarded
for a simple belt of wild-cats' tails. Their
weapons are the light assegai, or umkhonto, and this
spear can be thrown by them to the distance of
seventy or eighty yards, when at that it will have
sufficient strength to enter a man's body. Many of
the men even brought their guns, and showing Lord
Gifford how expert they were in their use, were
allowed to carry and employ them, instead of the
original native weapon. The Jantjis, like the Kaffirs
first, and then the Zulus, are beginning to find out
that the assegai is not a match for a gun; consequently,
as they have money, they procure a tolerably
large number of them. Like most of the Zulu tribes,
they build wickerwork huts, and thatch these with
the long tambookie grass. These huts are, as usual,
arranged in a circle, and thus form a village, or, as
we should say, a kraal. The men, unlike the Zulus,
are very fond of horses, and most of them can ride.
This makes them most useful as mercenaries and
levies. As they ride well, it is a pretty sight to see
those who are chosen as orderlies dashing along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
with the letter-bag upon the smart little horses given
them by Government. They utterly disdain the use
of a saddle, and always gallop along at full speed,
with an ostrich feather (if a chief) streaming in the
wind, and some wild animal's skin worn hussar
fashion, and floating behind. Even with their long
black legs almost touching the ground, there is
nothing grotesque in their appearance, though doubtless
in London such a horseman would cause astonishment.
Dashing up with a letter or heliographic
message from Sir Garnet, these fellows bring their
horses to a sudden stand, as Bedouins do, sending
the mould and grit beneath the hoofs flying in the
air. Saluting then most gracefully, with the spearhead
to the earth, the messenger springs to the
ground, and hands in his <i>paquet</i>.</p>

<p>To resume our narrative. On Sunday afternoon
(10th August), as Sir Garnet Wolseley was walking
with an aide-de-camp near the camp at Fort Victoria,
Ulundi, a man on foot was observed, apparently
lame and feeble, making the best of his way
towards our camp. With glasses it could be made
out that he came along with difficulty, limping
much, and occasionally casting a furtive glance
behind, as if in danger of being pursued. As ponies
were ready at hand and saddled, Sir Garnet mounted
and cantered out of the camp to see who the man
was. On coming to close quarters he found the
wayfarer to be no less a personage than one Cornelius
Vijn, a Dutch trader of Natal, who was known
to have been a prisoner for some time at Cetywayo's
kraal. His aspect and general appearance were, to
put it mildly, more those of a badly-dressed scarecrow
than those of a human being, and his haggard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and hungry contour, his wearied look, lean and
meagre, with eyes deeply sunk in their orbits, and
his parchment-like cheeks, hollow and cavernous, all
spoke with an eloquent voice of the ordeal he must
have undergone while the enforced guest of King
Cetywayo. The aide-de-camp, having with him a
flask and some biscuits, was enabled to somewhat
revive the fugitive, who then informed them who he
was, and how he had managed to escape from the
king's thrall. As his information was considered
highly important, Sir Garnet desired Mr. Vijn to
narrate briefly his story out of hearing of the camp
in order that any future operations or measures,
consequent upon the information given, might not
transpire to the outer world. The necessity for
this precaution had been of late forced upon the
General, who had had many of his plans and movements
made known by those upon whose discretion
while at headquarters he thought he could vouch
for. Besides, since his arrival in Natal, Sir Garnet
had achieved all his successes by striking without
warning, and by carefully concealing the movements
of troops, stores, &amp;c., from all but those actually in
command where the movement was to be made;
and there was but little doubt that the Zulus, in
the earlier portion of the war, obtained much of
their information from the Dutch, at least from that
section of the Boers who thought it their interest to
see the English army unsuccessful, and who consequently
made known to the enemy the British weak
points.</p>

<p>Mr. Vijn's narrative, although very long, did not
contain many details of general interest. He left
Natal for trading purposes as far back as the 29th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
of October, 1878, and about the middle of January
fell into the power of the king, who, however, does
not seem to have treated him at all rigorously, but
allowed him to remain at one of his brother's kraals
under a sort of friendly supervision. During this
detention Mr. Vijn appears to have kept a sort of
journal, which has a certain value, as showing the
opinions of the king, his brothers, and the Zulu
people in regard to the war. As Mr. Vijn's information
regarding the movements and whereabouts
of the king was both authentic and valuable,
and as he volunteered to return to Cetywayo and
persuade him to surrender, Sir Garnet decided to
avail himself of such offer. His presence near the
camp was, however, kept entirely secret, and having
been allowed to rest and refit, he was despatched
on his return journey, pledging himself to return if
possible by Tuesday evening with the king's answer.
On the following Wednesday Mr. Vijn came back
to the camp, and reported that his mission had
been unsuccessful, as the king had left the kraals
where Vijn had last seen him, and had fled away
to the north towards the Ngome forest. As soon
as this news was communicated to Sir Garnet, instructions
were given to Major Barrow to take a
troop of the King's Dragoon Guards, sixty mounted
infantry, some colonial levies and natives, making
in all a force of 220 whites and eighty natives, and
to proceed into the territory of those chiefs who
were still holding out, and where, it was supposed,
the king had taken refuge. Major Marter, K.D.G.,
Captain Maurice, Lord Gifford, Captain Hardy,
Captain Hay, and Mr. Herbert accompanied Major
Barrow, and they merely took with them, to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
as light marching order as possible, three days' preserved
rations&mdash;their commander wisely assuming
that they would find no great difficulty in foraging
as they went on. Half an hour after the order to
parade was given they were all in the saddle and ready
for the road. Sir Garnet, accompanied by Colonel
Colley, minutely inspected men, horses, equipment,
rations, and ammunition, and, after addressing a
few private words of advice to the officers, bade
them "God-speed."</p>

<p>Proceeding north-eastward at starting they soon
came to the little river Umbellan, which, flowing
past the dense bush of the district, ultimately joins
the Umvolosi. At this time of the year it is about
twenty feet deep, and murmurs along a channel of
from twenty to thirty feet wide, now and then
forming deep basins, which were found to be full of
fish. Soon after midnight the junction of the Black
Umvolosi was reached, and the first night's camp
was made near a fine tamarind-tree, which was
noted as a landmark in case of a return that way.
At this season there was a rather heavy dew towards
daybreak, but the nights were calm, and, in comparison
with the day, considerably colder than
would be expected.</p>

<p>Just as the party was ready and preparing to
start, after an early meal in the morning, some
natives came from a neighbouring kraal with the
information that on the previous night one of their
best oxen, having strayed outside the cattle enclosure,
had been seized and carried off by a lion.
It had already been stated by John Dunn that
the district through which they had to pass had
been for some years infested with lions, and lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the casualties had been so frequent that the inhabitants
were commencing to migrate. The
Umvolosi at its junction with the Umbellan is about
the same size as the latter river, and at this point
makes a most remarkable bend from south-east to
north-east, but its general direction for some distance
in this district is due north, the stream flowing
between banks twenty or thirty feet in height,
with an average width of full forty feet and a depth
of only three feet. The velocity of the current,
however, was 120 feet a minute. Leaving Amansekranze,
they marched about nine miles towards the
north-west, having on their left the Black Umvolosi,
and on their right the huge terraces and wood-crowned
ravines of the Lebombo mountains. The
woods came down to the river as it flowed between
its rocky banks; and farther north-west some wide
meadow-like flats were crossed, containing water
basins almost as large as lakes. Several kinds of
antelope of the larger sort, waterbucks, and hartebeests
appeared, and as the troopers managed to
wound and ride down several, their nightly bivouac
in the forest was solaced by a feast of excellent
venison. Between the Umvolosi and the Lebombo
range the previous uniformity of the rocks began
to be broken by projections of gneiss and by
scattered hills. About twelve miles from the
junction of the rivers at Amansekranze a remarkable
illustration of this formation was passed, where
huge blocks of stone rose in mounds from which
colossal obelisks could be cut. These elevated
places alternated with extensive flats as level as a
table-top. In keeping with this weird and fantastic
scenery and eccentric native architecture is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
peculiarity of the conies or rock rabbits that have
their dwelling among the crevices of the gneiss.
Soon after the sun went down, and just before sunrise,
they were to be seen all round squatting like
natives at the entrance of their holes, into which at
the slightest noise or sound of danger they darted
with the most extraordinary snorts and grunts.
There is, however, a great variety of species&mdash;difficult
for one who is not a skilled naturalist to
distinguish the one from the other&mdash;scattered
through the whole of Zululand, each district seeming
to present its own representative. They appear
to feed chiefly on the bark of trees, although they
will occasionally devour young shoots and grass.
Distinct from anything in the more civilized parts
of South Africa was the aspect of the landscape
presented to view on the second morning of the
march. From the heights to which Barrow and
his men had ascended, and as far as the eye could
reach, there extended a wide, grassy plain, broken
artistically by huge stones of the most fantastic
outline and by thickets and single trees. Graceful
and luxuriant palms of the fan species waved above
the groves, while the russet autumnal tints gave a
rich colouring to the scenery; every rock, with its
wealth of covering parasites, being a picture in
itself. In the far north could be seen the Mussipulo
and the distant portions of the Lebombo, whose
purple peaks stood out in bold relief in the pale
azure of the horizon. In the far distance, and in
the direction of the Amatongas, the country had
the deep and luscious blue of a Neapolitan sky,
mellowed, however, as it came nearer and nearer
into the most bewitching tints of grey and a golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
brown that Titian would have loved to paint. In
the foreground were the sturdy troopers of Marter's
squadron grouped in picturesque disorder as the
process of saddling went on. These with their
bright uniforms, and the glint of steel scabbard,
spur, and chain, were thrown out by the splendid
hues of a foliage rich and alternating with the
varied tints of red, yellow, and olive green, lightened
up with the glad freshness of the sprouting shrubs,
the deep red of the numerous ant-hills and the silver
grey of the jutting rocks.</p>

<p>After leaving the river, the way at first led over
what for horses alone, without wheels, was fair
trekking ground. They then descended for about
five miles, coming gradually down the slopes to a
sort of rough trampled pathway, evidently made by
a herd of driven cattle. Here could be distinctly
traced the spoor, and here the king's cattle had
evidently been driven. Now dipping into a deep
hollow, where the grass grew in rank luxuriance, now
topping a gentle rise and stopping to listen if they
could hear the distant horns of the Zulu sounded
when they announce the proximity of an enemy,&mdash;the
horsemen neared the forest-land at the foot of the
steep mountain range. Troops of eland crossed
their path now and then, and occasionally a herd of
koodoo. They now came to the end of the plain,
and had to pass over a much more difficult country,
where they could scarcely manage to get along
two abreast, and sometimes in Indian file. The
onward path at one portion of the kloof seemed completely
barred by a closely set forest of underwood
bush of dwarf acacia and creepers of the most tangled
nature. Indeed it seemed at one time impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
to pass, but Lord Gifford, after a search of some
moments, found the dry bed of a stream, up which,
he said, they might have a chance of progressing.
They had now to dismount and lead their horses,
and slowly and with the greatest difficulty made
their way on, sometimes crawling on hands and
knees, and having to drag their rifles after them,
winning way patiently, yard by yard, and almost
inch by inch. Sometimes they were fairly stopped
by huge masses of rock, and even compelled to cut
a road through the spiky branches of the mimosa,
which were bound up tightly together with the wild
vines and creeping cane-like plants. For more than
a mile did the column toil on through this ravine,
their clothes torn, and face and hands bleeding from
the thorns.</p>

<p>The morning after the first day's march brought
them to the kraals where the king had been a fortnight
previous to his flight, as stated to Sir Garnet
by the Dutch trader, and it was no surprise to find
these kraals burnt to the ground, and completely
deserted. Therefore, after a brief halt, they pushed
on, and did not draw rein until it became only too
evident that the tired horses could go no further.
They had been more than three and twenty hours in
the saddle, and the weight of the dragoons had told
severely upon Marter's horses, which, after the last
ten miles under a most burning sun, and over rough
and broken ground, were nearly all done up. On
coming to the next kraal they found they were still
upon the right track, as they gleaned sufficient
intelligence to know that the king had slept there
on the day preceding. He had, however, been
warned by scouts and signal-fires,&mdash;the latter had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
been noticed as they came along,&mdash;and had decamped
in time to get a good start. At this point Major
Barrow decided to leave the King's Dragoon Guards
behind, and push on with the lighter portion of his
mounted men, and this arrangement was carried out
with the understanding that the "King's" should
follow as soon as their horses were fit. Once more,
therefore, Barrow set out, and, as he subsequently
found, was upon the king's trail for two clear days,
having by dint of bribery and threats extorted
information as to the king's intentions. On Thursday
the column had a fearfully fatiguing and at the same
time disappointing day. They reached another
kraal at sundown, having travelled over a most
difficult and hilly country all day. Major Barrow
decided to bivouac at this kraal, and to start during
the night should the moon give sufficient light. The
moon, however, rose so late that it was really sunrise
when they were on the move on Friday morning.
Lord Gifford was now sent on ahead with a
few men, and it was subsequently found afterwards
that he and Captain Hardy chased and nearly caught
one of the king's principal attendants. This man
would have been caught had he not dexterously
abandoned his horse, and, taking to the jungle,
managed to elude further pursuit. Meanwhile the
main body followed on, and on Saturday came to
another kraal. One of the king's personal attendants
was here captured, who having been frightened
by a little threatening, showed where the king had
stayed and slept on Thursday. This fellow's statements
were somewhat contradictory and improbable.
He wished Major Barrow to believe that the king
meditated changing the direction of his flight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
endeavouring to gain the Inkhangla bush, which is
as nearly as possible opposite the Tugela middle
drift. But to make this point the king would have
had to get through the line of posts stationed in this
district, and this made the story seem improbable.
Major Barrow, however, taking the remote chance
of the man being truthful, and having no better
information, allowed the Zulu to take him in a retrograde
and southerly direction, until he met another
Zulu messenger, who said he had heard nothing of
the king along the road he came. Major Barrow
therefore retraced his steps to the camp of the main
body on the Black Umvolosi, and sent Lord Gifford
and Captain Maurice on with eight men to get some
cattle from a kraal and obtain what information he
could.</p>

<p>The first destination of this party was a kraal
with cattle and mealies, and this was said to be about
seven miles from where they were then halted. On
reaching the said kraal on Saturday afternoon they
surprised some Zulu boys, and partly by threats and
partly by persuasion induced them to come on to
another kraal, seven miles off. These boys, after
some pressing, confessed that on the previous day
(Friday), the king had endeavoured to double back
towards the south, and had slept within a mile of
where they had bivouacked, and had actually passed
the kraal where they then were. This intelligence
confirmed the story that had previously been told by
the king's attendant, and the information was at
once sent back to Major Barrow. On Saturday
night they slept in the kraal they had reached in
the afternoon, having during the day visited a
number of smaller kraals and villages, in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
captured many assegais and other weapons. They
thus had made a circuit and were now heading
almost due south, and though they had now been four
clear days in the saddle, had managed their three
days' supply of rations so well that they had still a
reserve to fall back upon. This feat of commissariat
skill was accomplished by obtaining wherever they
could such simple supplies as the kraals afforded&mdash;sour
milk, Indian corn cakes made of mealies,
pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and now and then a little
Kaffir beer, which after a time, and when the taste
is acquired, is not such very bad stuff. Sunday,
the 17th, was a most eventful day. Lord Gifford
paraded his men, and they started, as usual, just
before sunrise, their destination being an important
military kraal, which they had every reason to
believe the king must have visited. The gallant
leader had on the previous evening induced two
Zulu boys to accompany his men as guides, for the
shortest way was through the forest and across
country, where it was impossible to find the smallest
trace of a trek. When they set out, the whole of
the wood was veiled in mist, and the ground was
yet reeking with the early dew. But as the light
came on they were rewarded by seeing an immense
variety of forest shrubs. Especially beautiful was
the <i>Encephalartos</i>, which grew in abundance; most
noticeable too was a cabbage-shaped <i>Euphorbia</i>, as
well as a large variety of conspicuous shrubs, many
of them covered with such fine blossoms as to give
the wilderness the aspect of an artificial park.</p>

<p>About three miles to the right, and to the south
of the ford last crossed, rose several thickly-wooded
hills, and in the kloofs could be seen the smoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
kraals. The guides had by this time become quite
friendly and confidential, and by their advice more
than one of these kraals were surrounded, in hope
that if they did not see the king they might hear
of his more recent movements. At three of these
kraals they captured arms and ammunition, and
filled their haversacks with mealies, but could gain
no tidings of Cetywayo, although they knew he could
not be far off. In one instance they thought they
had discovered their prize, as coming out of the
forest they saw a portion of open country before them
and several natives on horseback and on foot about
two miles away to their right. The scenery they
were now approaching towards the south-west assumed
a character very different to the parklike
landscape through which they had been passing.
For many miles the eye rested upon treeless steppes
and flats, broken by bamboo and mimosa jungles
that seemed almost impenetrable, and standing in
detached groups, their dark olive green contrasted
admirably with the bright hue of the grass, giving a
complete novelty of character to the general aspect.
The moment the group of natives saw them emerge
from the forest they quickened their pace, and endeavoured
to gain the jungle to their left, while
Lord Gifford detached three of his men round a
small hill to cut them off. A most exciting race
now commenced, two Basutos joining in the pursuit,
and taking advantage of every rock and bush
to dodge and intercept the fugitives. Suddenly the
Zulus became aware of the party sent round the
hill to intercept them, and giving a shout of alarm
ran back in the direction of the kraal the English
troopers had left. This was exactly what was required,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
and galloping right across the plain the
troopers caught them halfway. These men were
found to be Zulus of the neighbourhood, and when
they were satisfied that their pursuers had no
hostile intentions they became quite friendly, offering
milk and Kaffir corn, as well as food for the
horses. They professed to be starting on a journey
to a kraal about ten miles off, belonging to a chief
named Isnabomlika, who, they said, was anxious for
the capture of the king, as he had grievously oppressed
him. Leaving these men, they continued
their march, and soon came to a tract of country
much better cultivated than any they had hitherto
seen. Maize-fields (mealies) showed that the ground
was fertile, and although no cattle was seen, the
presence of several kraals on the neighbouring hills
showed that the district was populous.</p>

<p>About midday they reached the large military
kraal where it was thought probable the king might
have stopped. His guides had served him with
fidelity, and so Lord Gifford promised to reward
them at headquarters with a present of cattle to
each. These lads had made themselves great
favourites with the men, who seemed quite to
fraternize with them. Their delight was unbounded
when the officers came across and killed with their
rifles any description of game, and they seemed
wonderfully impressed with the accuracy of the
shooting. They said it had been currently
reported in their neighbourhood that the king was
lame and could not travel fast, and that his
followers were leaving him every day. Just before
reaching the kraal one of the lads, an intelligent,
sharp little fellow, as he was running a few yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
in front of the horses, pointed out to Lord Gifford
the track of cattle leading away to the bush on the
right. They halted and had a consultation; but it
was decided not to follow these tracks, but to continue
on southwards, their object being, if possible,
to hem in the king, and drive him on towards the
pickets of Barrow's party or the scouts of General
Clarke, who had four companies of infantry, the
headquarters of the King's Dragoon Guards, and a
number of irregulars (cavalry and infantry) encamped
at the drift of the Black Umvolosi. As they knew
that Clarke's patrols were scouring the country to
the north and east, they had no fear of the king's
escape in that direction. But little information was
gained at the big kraal, where they off-saddled for
two hours, and fed their rather overworked mounts.
At three o'clock they again started and now made a
bend towards Entonjaneni, as by this course it was
considered they would have the best chance of intercepting
the king in his attempt to cut through the
cordon now drawn around him. The range of hills
which they now had on their right were the Umyati.
They are a continuation of the Ngome mountains,
which shoot out from the Lebombo towards the
west, and they form a portion of the ridge bordering
the southern or right bank of the Black Umvolosi.</p>

<p>On the summit, as far as the eye could reach,
there was an extensive plateau broken by detached
groves and handsome trees, and sloping down towards
the north to the stream. A few miles on they
came to some fine tamarinds, under the pleasant
shade of which another short halt and off-saddle was
made. Before reaching the river they had to cross
four little brooks that flowed in an easterly direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to join it. The first of these to the north of the
hills was the upper course of the Enhlongana, and
was full of water in a deep bed enclosed in an
avenue of trees. A ridge of hills ran parallel to the
path on the left, and after they had crossed the
second brook a mass of red rock, rising to about
300 feet was observed on the right. The long
grass was now very troublesome, coming up in
some places to the saddle-flaps, and tickling the
horses in a most unpleasant manner. Towards five
o'clock they entered the splendid forest of Enhlongana,
through which, but ten miles to the west,
they had passed some ten days before. After the
forest came an open steppe, with a distant view of
the hills in front, which they crossed, though more
to the west than before. The passage of the
Enhlongana having been accomplished without mishap,
the road began to ascend and led through a
wood, where the foliage was so dense that it was
quite impossible to see many steps in front.</p>

<p>It will be observed that there were no less than
twelve brooks crossed in the interval between the
march in the morning and the final bivouac on Sunday
night. These are all supplied more or less copiously
with water, even in the dry season; at least so said
the guides. Although all these streams have their
origin quite close to the left bank of the Enhlongana,
yet they take a very devious course before they
actually join it; the last five, indeed, do not actually
meet the river, but join another stream a little to
the west called the Ivuma, which unites itself with
the Black Umvolosi under the Ngome mountain.
On this watershed bamboo and mimosa jungles
extend over an area of many square miles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
species of bamboo which is thus found in such
masses is not so large as that one is accustomed to
see in India, Ceylon, or the Mauritius; and in the
manner of its growth it is not unlike an asparagus
bed in the summer-time, hundreds of sprouts starting
up from a single root, and drooping in the most
graceful curves over towards the ground. In other
respects the habit of the plant is similar to the
Indian bamboo. The night was now coming on;
they had ridden at the very least thirty-five miles,
besides exploring kraals, examining prisoners, and
galloping after wounded game. All knew and felt
instinctively that the king was in the toils, that he
could not have broken through the network spread
for him, and that it was a mere question of days as
to when he would be forced to surrender. The
horses were indeed fatigued, but none as yet were
lame, while the three days' rations of biscuit and
preserved meats, with which they had started, were
almost intact, so well had they been husbanded by
the men living on what they could shoot or obtain
from the kraals.</p>

<p>On Sunday night (August 17th) the bivouac was
made at the wild mountain kraal of Unhlovani;
some women, girls, and children were found here,
who at first were terribly frightened at the approach
of the troopers, but soon became reassured and
friendly. Indeed Lord Gifford had a wonderful
faculty of ingratiating himself with the native races,
and, after a little persuasion, made one of the chief's
daughters confess that, although the king did not
pass by this particular kraal, his attendants did but
two days since. She also added information of great
value, namely, that there were but two passes over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the mountain they had now reached, and that three
of the king's wives had passed over the eastern
road the day before, carrying bundles and food.
They further learnt that this girl had no possible
reason for sympathy for or loyalty to Cetywayo, inasmuch
as an old Zulu, who stated that she was his
niece, told them that the king, about two years ago,
suspecting her father of some pretended conspiracy,
had had him smelt out and killed, and that the
children were at Cetywayo's disposal for sale or gift.
On the following morning (Monday) the horses were
tolerably refreshed. They had a good amount of
forage given them, and a careful examination of each
animal showed that no back sinews were strained,
and that no sore backs had come on. A small
supply of sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and a quantity
of mealies were given to them by the chief's daughters,
whose hearts their leader had won by explaining
to them that the king's reign of terror was at
an end, and that henceforth they could marry any
young warrior they pleased. Bidding these Zulu
friends adieu, the party were in the saddle and on
the road by five o'clock; and, ascending by a path
pointed out by some boys of the kraal, they came to
a lofty ridge dominating the valley below, and along
which they pushed at a fast walk for about an hour.
From this ridge, which they were following as
quickly as the rugged nature of the narrow ledge
would allow, the view was magnificently grand. In
the foreground, where they were compelled to march
in single file, and where a halt was made every now
and then to allow a straggler to come up, was a
most inviting grove, with some of the most charming
types of tropical vegetation&mdash;the large-leaved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
blue-green anona, the purple <i>Grewia mollis</i>, and a
number of pretty little trees of the pine genus, that
gave a Swiss character to the scene. Having risen
in their march to an elevation of 2000 feet, they
gazed down upon a fine view of the valley and its
meandering rivers below. The banks of each stream
were marked by rows of tall reeds, and the morning
sun gleamed upon the mirror of the numerous backwaters,
while the distance revealed a series of
woody undulations in the direction of the Norwegian
mission station of Enhlongana. Turning sharply
round a curve in the rocky path, they came suddenly
upon a kraal nestled in a most secluded and difficult
spot, and here they found two good-looking and
very communicative Zulu girls, who fetched for them
some capital milk, and, after a little coaxing, told
them that the king's attendants had passed on that
way the previous evening. These women, as far as
could be gleaned from the interpreter, had also
suffered some wrong and oppression, and whatever
might be the political feeling or loyal tendencies of
Cetywayo's male subjects, it seemed tolerably evident
that the Zulu women would have no objection
to a change of government. These women at the
kraal having shown them a short cut down one side
of the ridge, they hastened on in the hope of overtaking
some of the king's following, and their
activity was soon rewarded by discovering a couple
of figures making their way hurriedly along the
lower ledge about a mile from them. One of the
officers volunteered to proceed on foot to cut these
people off by a sort of goat-path that seemed practicable
down the side of the cliff; and, accompanied
by one trooper, half-sliding, half-falling, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
desperate scramble, the gallant fellow reached the next
ledge at a point where it was evident the travellers
must pass. In ten minutes they came up&mdash;a tall
and stalwart Zulu with a bundle of assegais, accompanied
by a lad carrying a sort of canvas bag, something
in shape like those in which cricketers carry
a bat and flannel suit. At the word "Halt!"
accompanied by a presented revolver, the couple of
natives came to a stand, and on being questioned
declared they were messengers from the chief
Usibibo to a neighbouring kraal. As this story
seemed rather doubtful, it was determined to search
the cricket-bag, and they were not long in finding a
trophy that almost repaid them for their many
weary miles of travel. Inside was a very handsome
Henry rifle belonging to the king, a small leather
handbag, a number of cartridges, and a hand-mirror!
As such articles do not form the travelling appendages
of the ordinary Zulu, it was at once seen that
they were getting hotter and hotter on the trail.
While these two were thus carefully examining the
captured spoil, the main party came winding down
the kloof, having during their absence come suddenly
upon and surprised some more of Cetywayo's
attendants. A halt was immediately ordered, and
the whole of the prisoners examined one by one.</p>

<p>Some of the people from the friendly kraal had,
in the meantime, overtaken the English horsemen,
and their presence seemed to act as a wonderful
incentive to truth on the part of the prisoners. "Tell
them," said Lord Gifford, "that if they all speak
the truth to our questions we will do them no harm
and let them go free." This had a wonderful effect,
and, coupled with a private communication of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
confidential nature, from the Zulus of the kraal,
evidently to the effect that the white man's intentions
were not hostile to them, it caused the
prisoners to confess at once that they were of
the king's following, and that the elder was his
personal attendant. From further information then
obtained from these people it was found that a mile
further on, and hidden in a cave, were a troop of
Zulu girls and other attendants with goods and
chattels of the king. Guided by these not too
faithful adherents of Cetywayo, the troopers soon
came to where these people were, and they surrendered
at once without any attempt to escape.
These latter prisoners appeared to have with them
all the paraphernalia of the monarch's toilet. There
were gums, wax, and unguents for the hair and face,
brushes, combs, tweezers, scissors, and razors,
together with old pocket-books, almanacks, gaily-coloured
pocket-handkerchiefs, and charms and
medicine, made of ground human teeth, and hair
and skins of reptiles, reminding one irresistibly of
the ingredients of the witches' cauldron in Macbeth.
A silk pocket-handkerchief was recognized as
belonging to Colonel Degacher by the name in its
corner, and this was almost the only article that
could not be considered rags or rubbish. While
Lord Gifford and his party were holding a solemn
Court of Inquiry over this burlesque of human
vanity a loud whistle was heard, and coming round
the corner of the ledge, they saw Captain Hay and
a Basuto approaching at a smart canter. Hay,
flinging himself from his panting mount, and wiping
the perspiration from his forehead, announced that
he was sent on by Major Barrow, to say that, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
himself failed in obtaining any traces of the king,
and deeming it inadvisable to delay the others in
waiting for him to catch them up, he had decided
to increase Lord Gifford's little force with twenty
Basutos, under their leader, Jantzi, and to leave the
pursuit of the king in his (Gifford's) hands, while
he (Barrow) made his way back to Clarke's camp.
Meanwhile, the arrival of these additions to the
English force seemed to exercise a marked influence
upon the ladies of the king's household, who immediately
jumped at the conclusion that Cetywayo
had fallen into the hands of the soldiers. This
had a wonderful effect, as they now discovered
from the women and attendants where the king had
actually slept the previous day, and armed with
this information, they pushed on, bivouacked for
the night at the nearest kraal, and started before
daybreak on the following morning. From these
prisoners they learnt, moreover, several most important
and invaluable pieces of information: first,
that the poor king was almost deserted; secondly,
that he had been obliged to abandon his horses;
and, thirdly, that he was ill and footsore.</p>

<p>From Tuesday, the 19th, until Wednesday, the
27th, long marches were incessant, and to describe
the adventures that befell this small party would
be merely a repetition of those already told. The
arrival of Jantzi and the timely reinforcements of
Basutos enabled Lord Gifford to detach parties and
hem in the fugitive monarch in a manner he could
not have effected with only nine men. It was now
almost a point of honour with Gifford that his men
should succeed in capturing the king after the way
in which Barrow had entrusted the pursuit to him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and although he knew that the king was pursued
by Barton's Native Infantry, three companies of the
57th, and 150 of Marter's Dragoons, he still felt
confident that his party alone were upon the right
track. Marter he had heard had gone back after
losing three of his horses by lions in the district
through which he had passed; and his only fear
now was that the Mounted Police would take the
wind out of his sails by a rapid move from the
Transvaal, and capture the king should he attempt
to escape towards the north. This he considered
was not improbable, as he had news from Villiers
up to the 12th, saying that the tribes in his neighbourhood
were most unfriendly, and anxious to
afford help to the king. Indeed they had attempted
an attack upon the mixed force organized by
Villiers, but had been easily beaten off. The movements
of Gifford's party from the 20th (Wednesday)
up to the 26th, were not of special interest. They
marched and countermarched, the king never far
in front, but always managing to keep thirty or forty
miles between himself and them, and their information
sometimes right and sometimes wrong, according
to the feelings of the natives whom they questioned.</p>

<p>On the 25th they had tolerably authentic information
that the king had decided to come in to Lord
Gifford, and surrender. Dabulamanzi, however, a
brave soldier although a double-dyed and scheming
traitor, wrote or sent to the king, telling him the
English would hang or shoot him if he surrendered.
Dabulamanzi's object was most transparent. He
hoped the king might be killed or die in the wilds
of starvation, as then he might possibly be made the
English nominee to the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>Jumping over the interval between Monday, 18th
August, and that day week, during which the pursuer's
movements merely resembled those of a pack
of harriers when "pussy" will keep dodging and
doubling over the same ground, we may come to
the incidents which led up to the king's capture.
On Monday night, 28th August, scouts came in,
who kept Gifford and his party well in line with the
king's refuge, and although their horses were nearly
dropping from fatigue they marched on Tuesday
and on through Tuesday night, until at daybreak on
Wednesday they came to a large kraal situated
close to the Ngome forest, where it was known the
king had passed the previous night. This kraal
was situated in a most curious and out-of-the-way
portion of the land that skirted the forest, and,
hidden as it was between two high kops, it might
have been easily passed unobserved had it not been
for the information Lord Gifford had been enabled
to obtain. They approached this kraal at dusk,
and found that the king had left early in the morning.
Some mats, two blankets, and a snuff-box
were recognized as belonging to the king. A couple
of lads were caught, who at first would tell nothing,
but Lord Gifford, assuming a stern air, ordered
them both to be blindfolded, and said in their own
language, "Shoot first one and then the other!"
A volley was fired, and the ruse succeeded, for one
boy had been led away out of sight, and the other,
thinking he was shot, exclaimed, "They will kill me
next; I will confess!" He accordingly said, if his
life were spared, he would conduct Lord Gifford to
the king's hiding-place.</p>

<p>What was to be done? The horses had had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
terrible ten days' "bucketing," the men were tired,
hungry, and incapable of great fatigue; but when
their chief said, "My lads, we must do it to-night!"
every heart beat high with enthusiasm, and hunger,
thirst, and fatigue, were at once forgotten. That
night-march, conducted by the Zulu boy, was an
event that will never be forgotten by those engaged
therein. Scarcely had the sun disappeared below
the horizon when the devoted little band started
on their way, and the novelty of their position in
the wilderness could hardly be realized by those
who were not used to the country&mdash;the deep hum
of hundreds of insect creatures signalling their
presence to each other, the lizards and poisonous
snakes that crawled across the path, the grim, gaunt
figure of the beast of prey stalking near the projecting
rock, the yells of the monkeys, and the howl of
the wild dogs in the plain. Busy, silent, spectral-like
forms passed in the night, and, with a snort of
terror or a growl of anger, moved out of the path,
scarcely liking to let pass such defenceless creatures
as men seem to be, yet apparently in awe of a certain
presence which the brute creation can never
thoroughly overcome. Tiny creeping animals
crackled the crisp leaves as they scampered about in
their fastnesses among the bushes, and sniffed the
scent of the strange intruder, while the noiseless
flapping of wings attracted for an instant the
soldier's sight as some ghostlike moving night-bird
flew around and examined the strange being that
intruded in his domain. Having marched all Tuesday
night, with men and horses almost dead with
fatigue, they arrived at daybreak within four miles
of the kraal where they were told the king was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
lying. He was, they knew, footsore, weary almost
unto death, and so despondent that he would
scarcely speak to those who still continued with
him. Lord Gifford, knowing the king could go no
farther, deemed his capture more certain in the
dusk, and accordingly sent back a message to Major
Marter, who was known to be not far off, for him to
come up on the opposite side to that on which he and
his men were posted. Where Lord Gifford was posted
was a splendid ambush, as they could see without
being seen, and during the day they noticed that
an ox was killed and preparations made for a feast.
They also saw Marter's men appear on the opposite
heights, and then they knew that their task was
virtually accomplished. Gifford's ambush, it may
be remarked, was on the south-east side, while
Marter had posted his men on the north-east.</p>

<p>The king, it was subsequently learnt, saw Marter,
but did not see Gifford's men, and he considered
that the cavalry could not approach without his
knowing. But Marter had wisely taken off his
saddles, and made his men leave their steel scabbards,
advancing only with numnahs and naked
swords, and then, disappearing into the bush as if
disappointed in his quest, the major stole up quietly
by a circuitous route to the kraal, and surrounded
the king's hut. The Native Contingent were
actually the men first up, as they were on foot, and
could move more rapidly than the horses. These
fellows dashed at the kraal, saying to the king's
attendants, "The white man is here, you are
caught!" Major Marter then rode up quietly to
the king's hut, inside the kraal, and called upon
Cetywayo to surrender. The king said, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
certain amount of dignity, "Enter into my hut; I
am your prisoner!" Major Marter, however, declined
this invitation, and prudently invited the
king again to come forth. This was the final
picture! A Zulu kraal is, perhaps, a refuge with
as little of the picturesque or dignified as any known
habitation, yet the poor king, somewhat bloated in
appearance, weak, footsore, and evidently sick at
heart, came out of his refuge with a royal dignity
which could not be surpassed, and when a too heedless
dragoon tried to touch him, said, in grave and
majestic tones, "White soldier, do not touch me&mdash;I
surrender to your chief."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lord Gifford, to whom, beyond all
doubt, the capture was due, as he alone tracked
down the quarry, galloped in, and the king expressly
said he surrendered to him, and not to Major
Marter. With haughty gaze and supremely regal
though savage dignity, with head erect, and the
mien of a Roman Emperor, Cetywayo marched between
the two lines of the 60th Rifles to his tent,
while the men, by the order of Lord Gifford, presented
arms to him as he passed. Such was the
final scene of the Zulu War.</p>

<h4>NARRATIVE OF CETYWAYO'S WANDERINGS AFTER
ULUNDI, TAKEN FROM HIS OWN LIPS.</h4>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> following account of Cetywayo's movements after the battle of
Ulundi is of great interest as having been taken directly from his
lips since he has been confined in Capetown:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cetywayo was not present at Ulundi; he was then at the
kraal of a chief called Umbonambi, which is situated about three
miles north of Kwamizekanze. One of Cetywayo's brothers, Uziwetu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
in company with Vijn, the captured German trader, had
posted himself on the summit of the Uncungi hill, and thus witnessed
the conflict. Men, also, had been placed on the look-out,
and they brought the news of his army's defeat to Cetywayo, who,
at once crossing the neck of the Ntabankulu mountains, retreated
into the bush beyond, where he was joined by Umnyama and
other chiefs. Vijn and Uziwetu came to the king on the following
day, but after a short interview withdrew to Uziwetu's kraal of
Ematina. Cetywayo then retired to Ekushu Maileni, a kraal
belonging to Umnyama, his prime minister, which is on the banks
of the river Isiqmeshi. Arriving here three days after the engagement,
he received news of the retreat of the English army; this
determined him to remain where he was; so he lived in this kraal
for nearly three weeks.</p>

<p>"When information of Sir Garnet Wolseley's advance was
brought to him, Cetywayo despatched three chiefs to meet the
General, and tell him that the king was getting together his cattle,
and would send them on to Sir Garnet by his minister Umnyama,
who was then personally engaged in collecting the royal herds.
These messengers, having fallen in with a detachment of Clarke's
column, were directed by them to Entonjaneni, where they met
Sir Garnet on his arrival. Vijn, in the meantime, had, by the
king's command, gone to Fort Victoria bearing a similar message,
with this addition, that after the cattle had been received by the
English commander he would give himself up. During Vijn's
absence Cetywayo moved on to Zonymana's kraal; here he was
rejoined by Vijn, who told him that the English were thoroughly
determined to capture him. Hereupon he sent Vijn a second
time to Sir Garnet, with no definite proposals, but merely a complaint
that he could not give himself up to any of the patrols, as
he was apprehensive that he would be killed out of hand. And
there was some ground for this fear, as Dabulamanzi had sent a
message warning him that the English meant to put him to death,
and so he had better not yield himself up until the cattle had been
received and Umnyama made terms for him with the English commander.
The three first messengers, after leaving Entonjaneni,
fell in with Umnyama and the cattle near Ulundi, whither they
betook themselves, in company with that chieftain, instead of
returning to Cetywayo.</p>

<p>"The morning following that on which Vijn had been despatched
on his second embassy the king moved on to the river
Mona, and slept that night in a kraal upon its bank. On the next
morning, having crossed the stream, he was ascending the hill that
rose on the other side when a messenger from his brother Uziwetu
came to tell him that soldiers on horseback had just visited Zonymana's
kraal. He therefore concealed himself in the bush, and in
no long time beheld the white men's scouts on the opposite hill;
thereupon he descended the ravine into the Mona bush. The same
evening he travelled as far as the Black Umvolosi, and slept there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
On the following day they had scarcely finished killing and skinning
a couple of oxen when scouts came in to say the white horsemen
were coming through the bush. The king then bade all the
women to escape as best they could, whilst he, going out of the
bush, concealed himself in the long grass on the top of a mound
just above the drift, whence he could clearly watch the patrol as
they passed, and, indeed, could hear them speak and laugh. As
soon as they had passed, he and the five or six followers, who were
now all the retainers that remained with him, journeyed further
up the Black Umvolosi, and lived for some days in various kraals.
Remaining for three days in the same kraal, he was joined by one
of his wives. Finding the troops still on the trail, he now struck
off across country into the Ingome forest, where news reached him
that Umnyama had, instead of making terms for him, promised
Sir Garnet Wolseley to use his best endeavours to capture the king
and to deliver him up should he be found in any of the kraals of
his (Umnyama's) district. Cetywayo was much grieved at this,
and exclaimed, 'Why does Umnyama do this? Why does he act
treacherously towards me? Why does he not send a message to
tell me to deliver myself up?' He then moved on to the kraal of
the Ingome, where four more women rejoined him. Here he was
taken by Lord Gifford and Major Marter, and conducted by them
back to Ulundi. On the way one of the women escaped into the
bush."</p>

<h3>NOTE II.</h3>

<h4>FATE OF CETYWAYO AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF
ZULULAND.</h4>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Cetywayo</span> was first taken to Sir Garnet Wolseley at Ulundi, and
thence by that General's orders was conveyed, under an escort
commanded by Captain Poole, R.A., to Capetown, where he still
remains in an honourable captivity, treated with all the respect
and indulgence due to his position.</p>

<p>After Cetywayo's capture no further opposition of any sort was
encountered in Zululand, but the chiefs and people immediately
assented to the terms of peace proposed by Sir Garnet, by which
the country was split up into thirteen districts, each subject to its
own chief, while supreme over all these was placed a British
resident. Native laws and customs were to be respected, and
European immigration was forbidden. Mr. Wheelwright, for some
considerable time a magistrate of Natal, was appointed the first
resident.</p>
